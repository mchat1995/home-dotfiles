There is a place in the distance
A place that I've been dreaming of
Out time and space, don't exist there
We can dance like there's no tomorrow

There is a place
Out time and space

(I got tomorrow to)
(I got to all the way)
(I got tomorrow to)
(I got to all the way)
(I got tomorrow to)
(I got to all the way)
(I got tomorrow to)

I can feel the city crumbling around me
Can't seem to find my way
But I can see a bright light calling through the dark night
Hoping I'll find my way

Yeah, I had what I wanted
It went away so fast, fast
Yeah, I got to let go
We can dance like there's no tomorrow
(So here we go)

(I got tomorrow to)
(I got to all the way)
(I got tomorrow to)
(I got to all the way)
(I got tomorrow to)
(I got to all the way)
(I got tomorrow to)

I can feel the heartbeat underneath the concrete
Just like a kick drum plays
Running in a straight line guided by the street lights
Pushing the dark away

Yeah I had what I wanted
It went away so fast, fast
Yeah I got to let go
We can dance like there's no tomorrow

There is a place in the distance
A place that I've been dreaming of
Out time and space, don't exist there
We can dance like there's no tomorrow

There is a place in the distance
A place that I've been dreaming of
Out time and space
We can dance like there's no tomorrow, oh, oh, oh

(I got tomorrow to)
(I got to all the way)
(I got tomorrow to)
(I got to all the way)
(I got tomorrow to)
(I got to all the way)
(I got tomorrow to)

Tomorrow
Tomorrow
We can dance
