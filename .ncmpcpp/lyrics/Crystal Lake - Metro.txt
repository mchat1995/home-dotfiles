Welcome to the city of this masquerade where you can find the realist in this fake charade
You can see the sky scraped, flooded with codes making you reminisce from the life you chose
Ones and Os
Stuck in a rut with no air to breathe
Ones and Os
Dollar dollar bills ruling everything around me

How can we breathe in the city that never sleeps
Have we become a victim of the obsolete
How can we dream in the city that never sleeps
How can we bleed for this city that’s bitter sweet

We stand up higher than they can build
We rise up and let the city know
We stand up higher than they can build
To open up the skies to count the stars as we sleep tonight

The rats in the streets playing hide and seek
While these motherfuckers looking for a way to eat
To live to breathe, or breathe to live is nothing more than your means to live
Nothing more than your means to live
C.R.E.A.M
Suits and ties with cuffs and stripes
Open up and there’s nothing inside

We stand up higher than they can build
We rise up and let the city know

We stand up higher than they can build
To open up the skies to count the stars as we sleep tonight

One in this million
One in a million
We are the reckoning
One in this million is all we are
One in a million is all we need
