English Translation

My Baby, Sweet Baby
I see you smiling when I close my eyes
'Cause I miss you, I need you right now

For my fragile heart not saying "I'm back", I'm sorry
Never knew I'd make you feel lonely
My way of saying "I'm tired" is past now
The way I was waiting to return was painful.

And we're Back to Screaming
The trivial thing
Can't stop the rain yet
So we both surrender
Together again
'Cause only you can drive me crazy

My baby, sweet baby oh
You're always unable to be honest with me
Your gentle shyness makes you unique.

Do you believe in destiny?
'Cause I can't deny, baby you and I
Why are we living here?

If the two of us must meet by chance,
What kind of other difficulties must be surpassed?

Think about the conveniences well
You are still troubled
That kind of thinking, I still depend on you too much even today
'Cause Only I can't drive you crazy!

My baby, sweet baby, After this I want to talk to the future you!
That is what my heart tells me

Naa Baby, Please tell me? oh
Because it's fine without words
Being next to you smiling is my only wish.

The world's in a hurry
Our time has been stopped early
There's nothing to worry
Time won't lead us apart.
