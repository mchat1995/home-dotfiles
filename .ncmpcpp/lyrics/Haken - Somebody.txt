Still I feel the pain from that day
When you stepped in to take my dreams away
The stage was set for what would be my night
But you called time and threw my fight

Still I'm yearning
To claim back what's mine
Still I'm clinging
To dreams that won't die
Still I'm dreaming
Of one more chance
But you still tell me
My time has passed

Give me back my right to prove that I can fight
Let me show them all
Tonight can be my night

"You'll never know
The lengths to which I will crawl
'Cause tonight is my night
You will not tear down my wall"

Still you think
That it's ok
For you to state
The rules of play
But if you could know
The length to which I crawl
To reclaim my pride
And break down your walls

Still I'm yearning
To claim back what's mine
Still I'm clinging
To dreams that won't die
Still I'm dreaming
Of one more chance
But you still tell me
My time has passed

Give me back my right to prove that I can fight
Let me show them all
Tonight will be my night

I wish I could have been somebody

Just as a bird was meant to fly
Unbind these wings or let me die

Give me back my right to prove that I can fight
Let me show them all
Tonight this is my night
