I wish I could hold
I wish I could touch
But a fool
Just wants and wants
It's all what you do when no one cares
No one's chasing you
No one's making you
Spend lonely nights
Poisoned through and through
It's all what you do when no one is there
It's all what you do when no one cares

I get lost and think
Lose myself to dreams
The world moves anyway
The world will have it's say
Lord, I'm wondering
If what you're telling me
Is I've got work to do
Yes, I've got work to do

I wish I could hold
I wish I could touch
But a fool
Just wants and wants and wants and wants
It's all what you do when no one is there
It's all what you do when no one cares
