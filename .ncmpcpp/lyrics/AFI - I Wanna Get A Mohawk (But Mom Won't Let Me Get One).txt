Go! I may be ten years old, but
I still know what's up, I
Wear my Cramps shirt almost every single day

I wanna sag my pants
I wanna pogo dance
But mom won't let me
So I might just run away

I, I wanna ride my skate
I wanna stay out late
I wanna mohawk
Mom won't let me get one

I, I wanna go to shows
Don't wanna pierce my nose
I wanna mohawk
Mom won't let me get one

I may be in fourth grade, but
Know what's going on
Listen to the Misfits every single day

Don't wanna take a nap
I wanna TV tat
But mom won't let me
So I might just disobey

I, I wanna ride my skate
I wanna stay out late
I wanna mohawk
Mom won't let me get one

I, I wanna go to shows
Don't wanna pierce my nose
I wanna mohawk
Mom won't let me get one
