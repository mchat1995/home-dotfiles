It's too much to take, the thought of it all
Release me distraction
It's too much to take, the thought of my fall
Shameful attraction
What happened to the place I'd hide?
Who taught you how to sneak inside?
It's too much to take. It's too much to take

I saw you step upon that bridge
I saw you walk across that bridge
I saw you float above that bridge

I saw you step upon that bridge
I saw you walk across that bridge
I saw you float above our bridge
And I've floated since that day

It's too much to take, the thought of it all
Release me distraction
It's too much to take, the thought of my fall
Shameful attraction
What happened to the place I'd hide?
I taught you how to sneak inside
It's too much to take. It's too much to take
It's too much to take. It's too...

I saw you step upon that bridge
I saw you walk across that bridge
I saw you float above that bridge

I saw you step upon that bridge
I saw you walk across that bridge
I saw you float above our bridge
And I've floated since that day

I thought I saw the sky
I thought I saw the sky
I thought I saw the sky
Behind your eyes

I thought I saw the sky
I thought I saw the sky
I thought I saw the sky
Behind your eyes

I saw you step upon that bridge
I saw you walk across that bridge
I saw you float above that bridge

I saw you step upon that bridge
I saw you walk across that bridge
I saw you float above our bridge
And I've floated since that day
