One last thing I beg you please, just before you go
I've watched you fly on paper wings, halfway 'round the world
Until they burned up in the atmosphere, and sent you spiraling down
Landed somewhere far from here with no one else around
To catch you falling down
And I'm looking at you now

And I can't tell if you're laughing
Between each smile there's a tear in your eye
There's a train leaving town in an hour
It's not waiting for you and neither am I

Swing for the fences, son
He must have told you once
That was a conversation you took nothing from
So raise your glass now and celebrate exactly what you've done
Just put off another day of knowing where you're from
You can catch up with yourself, if you run...

And I can't tell if you're laughing
Between each smile there's a tear in your eye
There's a train leaving town in an hour
It's not waiting for you and neither am I

Is this the life that you lead?
Or the life that's lead for you?
Will you take the road that's been laid out before you?
Will we cross paths somewhere else tonight?
Somewhere else tonight...

And I can't tell if you're laughing
Between each smile there's a tear in your eye
There's a train leaving town in an hour
It's not waiting for you and neither am I

And I can't tell if you're laughing
Between each smile there's a tear in your eye
There's a train leaving town in an hour
It's not waiting for you and neither am I
