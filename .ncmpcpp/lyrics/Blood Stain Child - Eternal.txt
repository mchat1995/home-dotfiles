Over the clouds
New world and blue silence
Spread before me
All the possibilities are there

So far away eternal spring over Elysium
Even if your surroundings are the dark

You may open your eyes and breathe
I'm free and you are free
The blue sky spreads out infinitely
Eternal light

So far away eternal spring over Elysium
Even if your surroundings are the dark
Now rise and take my hand
As Lethe beckons, ending your torment
This sky accepts everything

Solitary love letters to an uncertain future,
Colored by a cosmic jokers sense of reason
Life is not without hope,
But each one of us is hopelessly human

You're just a shapeless human mass
Crawling blind in empty space
Confront yourself your darkened face

Beyond the clouds harmonic space towards infinity
I may die so that you may live
Arise and breathe again the sun in my eyes
Drying your rain away
Your heart shines surely sometimes

Spread your wings fly away
Blissful light dawning, calling...

Heaven in the sky

So far away eternal spring over Elysium
Even if your surroundings are the dark
Now rise and take my hand
As Lethe beckons, ending your torment
This sky accepts everything
Beyond the clouds harmonic space towards infinity
I may die so that you may live
Arise and breathe again the sun in my eyes
Drying your rain away
Your heart shines surely sometimes
