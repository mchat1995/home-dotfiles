I can feel you
Waiting for me
When the sun
Retreats to the hills and I
Below the blanket of a burning sky
Wrap myself within
Embraced by dead leaves
As the rain leaves
Trails of black down my face
And I creep through the twilight
To that hidden place
Beyond the lonely
I'll meet you
(Tonight)
(In the whispers when no one's around)
Nothing can stop us now
(Tonight)
(In the whispers where we won't be found)
Nothing can stop us now

I can feel you
Dreaming of me
And the time when our steps are retraced
And I creep through the twilight
To that hidden place
Beyond the lonely
I'll meet you
(Tonight)
(In the whispers when no one's around)
Nothing can stop us now
(Tonight)
(In the whispers where we won't be found)
Nothing can stop us now
(Tonight)
(In the whispers when no one's around)
Nothing can stop us now
(Tonight)
(In the whispers where we won't be found)
Nothing can stop us
Oh...

I can feel you dreamin' of me
I can feel you dreamin'
I can feel you dreamin' of me
Beneath a dream
Beneath a dream
(One world away)
I can feel you dreamin' of me
(We were just one world away)
I can feel you dreamin'
(In silent rapture one world away)
I can feel you dreamin' of me
(One world away)
Lost in a dream
Lost in a dream
(Tonight)
(In the whispers when no one's around)
Nothing can stop us now
(Tonight)
(In the whispers where we won't be found)
Nothing can stop us now
(Tonight)
(In the whispers when no one's around)
Nothing can stop us now
(Tonight)
(In the whispers where we won't be found)
Nothing can stop us!
Oh...
