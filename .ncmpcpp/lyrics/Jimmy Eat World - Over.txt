I'm not exactly sure what I should say
Everything I do is a mistake
Your attention is attention (It doesn't matter if it's fake or real)
I'll take it if I get it, oh
I've made up my mind
I'll do it over any time

You're over it, over me
Present just physically
Last words from the dying scene
You're over me

You're over me

I really need to hear how great I am
'Cause I can't even get up out of bed
Now say it like you mean it (Doesn't matter how I really feel)
Sing it back softly, oh
You got to be strong and I've been empty oh so long

You're over it, over me
Present just physically
Last words from the dying scene
You're over me

The old days all went bad
Rotted, wilted black
Before you'd have a chance to call
I'll be on the next train home
Add it to the endless list of all the things we'll never ever know

You're over it, over me
Present just physically
Last words from the dying scene
You're over me

You're over me
You're over me
