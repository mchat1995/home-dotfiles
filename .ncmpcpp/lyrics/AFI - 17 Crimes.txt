If you had a day
Would you give me a moment?
Would you allow our play
To leave no bone unbroken?

Let's love like seventeen
I'm in love with poisoning
Only bring your pretty frightful gifts to me
Let's love and kill like seventeen now

If I weren't so cold
We could unfreeze this moment
And as the world grow old
We'll leave no heart unbroken

Let's love like seventeen
I'm in love with poisoning
Only bring your pretty frightful gifts to me
Let's love and kill like seventeen now

Tomorrow cannot be like this
And even though it's such a sin, oh well
Tomorrow cannot be like this
Tomorrow they will take us in
We'll leave no heart unbroken.

Let's love like seventeen
I'm in love with poisoning
Only bring your pretty frightful gifts to me
Let's love and kill like seventeen now

I'm in love with your new screams
Only bring those pretty frightful things to me
Let's run and kill like seventeen now
Let's run and kill like seventeen now
Let's run and kill like seventeen
