Along the path where the stream is talking
I breathe the mist and continue walking
The wood, it whispers in a language of its own

As a sigh escaped my lips
I feel the light caress of fingertips
That steal away the breath and leave me on my own

Waiting by the stairs
Waiting, I despair
Waiting, I despair
Waiting by the stairs

My whole life is a dark room
One, big, dark room

Do I hear the hollow sound?
Footsteps resounding on this frozen ground
Or the familiar disappointment of the echoes of my own?

Waiting by the stairs
Waiting, I despair
Waiting, I despair
Waiting by the stairs

Somehow I ended up here in between
Where there is always the comfort
Of knowing I'll never be seen
When I fall

When I fall
I wait for just one touch

And I fall weightless, endless
Faithless, I'll adore you
A single touch, before I fade
Painless let me pass through

Weightless, endless
Faithless, I'll adore you
A single touch, before I fade
Painless let me pass through
