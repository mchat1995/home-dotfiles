All mixed up
Turned around
What are you thinking about?
What were we talking about now?
Emotion-free euphoric state
Too little, too late
(Late)

You pray for rain in hopes that it'll wash away
Well, let's be honest
You don't have that much faith
I think it's too late if you're looking to save face
I see you slipping from that
Throne of grace

Focus stuck
All burned out
You're thinking too loud
All that comes, has to comedown
At least you can say you tried to pray for rain

You pray for rain in hopes that it'll wash away
Well, let's be honest
You don't have that much faith
I think it's too late if you're looking to save face
I see you slipping from that
Throne of grace

Why do we ask for these selfish ways?
Are we the only ones that need saving?
(Save me)
I think we were foolish in thought
Then again, I'm probably wrong
I'm probably wrong

(You pray for rain in hopes that it'll wash away)
Well, let's be honest
You don't have that much faith
I think it's too late if you're looking to save face
I see you slipping from that
(I see you slipping from that)
I see you slipping from that throne of grace
