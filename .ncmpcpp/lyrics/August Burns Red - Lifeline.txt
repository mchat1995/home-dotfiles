Sometimes it's best to keep it all in. Words carry no weight-
If the sincerity is questioned

The kindest compliment can do the most damage
When all it does is form an illusion
Trapped inside an inflated sense of self-worth
It will explode leaving nothing but the burns
It'll only get worse as it leads to hurt
As it leads to hurt, it leads to hurt

If there's no meaning, there'll be no inspiration
Another missed chance at molding aspirations
Don't look away from their eyes
Everyone needs a restart from time to time to time
Don't look away from their eyes
Push and teach and criticize (Push and teach and criticize)

Let them fall, let them fail
Feel the stings of failure (Feel the stings of failure)
Don't look away from their eyes, from their eyes

A mistake is a chance to grow
Into something stronger and bolder than they may know
They'll learn to stand on their own

They'll speak up when no one mutes their mouth
Don't throw the lifeline if no one calls for help
They'll speak up when no one mutes their mouth
It means they're navigating for themselves

Becoming self-sufficient is one of life's biggest missions
Conflicts and stumbles are just obstacles towards making their- Own decisions, their own decisions

Have more faith, they can battle the elements
Have more faith, don't be the detriment
Have more faith, they can battle the elements
Have more faith, don't be the detriment

Have more faith
