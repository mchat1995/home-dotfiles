(Andrew Jackson)
Snowfall on the treetops
The streets are bare
Bright lights in the window
And up the stairs
In all of your silence
In all of your songs
I still hear the choir
But you are gone

Can't go back
Can't fight this

Water, water
Teardrops are falling like rain
Daughter, daughter
Still hear you calling my name
I'll see your light
In the water for all my life

I'm standing on my tiptoes
I'm coming undone
You were my hero when I was young
We live, but we never know
We're lost in the wind
A million candles, just flickering

Can't go back
Can't fight this

Water, water
Teardrops are falling like rain
Daughter, daughter
Still hear you calling my name
I'll see your light
In the water for all my life

Lifted high
Let me lay down at your side
Here I'll stay
Till your soul comes back to mine

Water, water
Teardrops are falling like rain
Daughter, daughter
Still hear you calling my name
I'll see your light
In the water for all my life
