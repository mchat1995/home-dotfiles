God of eternal, please lead him under
You tragedy of time call on him.
It's silence of life, silence of tear
We did not know what to do.

Wave of sorrow roll upon us.
That is world of nihil.

We praied, Oh Father is in Heaven.
We can't see him again.
We must not this sorrow of destiny.
Your soul will keep onb living eternally.

Time of the past will live forever.
Nobody can kill it.

We sing a Mass for you from this hell.
Your heart doesn't vanish as long as we live.

Your heart...
