I hear a heartbeat
Beckoning from the dark side
One sould after another have vanished
The cry of terror is out of hearing
The king of the dead cut the necks of the weak
By stalking them

Don't be faint heart!
He play on you right away
Death exist at the back of human beings
The dark part of your heart wants the death

The rise of all the fall
Don't forget! It's the hungout of the king
The shadow of deah has been on your back

Every seduction whirl in the world

The rise of all the fall
Don't forget! It's the hungout of the king
The shadow of deah has been on your back
