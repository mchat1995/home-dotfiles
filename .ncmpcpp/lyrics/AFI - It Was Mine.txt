Don't move
Don't do anything
What we captured got away
Slipped from us

Don't speak, don't
Don't say anything
They've been recording all we say
For years now

You won't see them right away
But you'll hear them singing
Hold me closely now, but don't
Don't say anything
They've come to take me away
And won't leave until I'm gone
I know

Don't feel
Don't love anything
Love attracts all those who taint
The cherished

Don't try to
To change anything
Nothing pure can ever stay

You won't see them right away
But you'll hear them singing
Hold me closely now, but don't
Don't say anything
They've come to take me away
And won't leave until I'm gone

They'll say
"Relax, you'll be fine"
(All we love goes away)
They'll take
All you let them find
(All we love goes away)
It was mine

It was mine

You won't see them right away
But you'll hear them singing
Hold me closely
But don't say anything
They've come to take me away
And won't leave until I'm gone

Don't say anything
Don't say anything
They won't leave until I'm gone

I'm gone
