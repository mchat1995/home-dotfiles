Eins (eins), zwei (zwei), drei (drei), vier

You do not exist
The world doesn't exist
I cannot touch them
My mind is projected

Projected desire
Momentary relief
I dive in a new world
The image changes bewilderingly
Where do I go?

All the creation goes away from me
I see light beyond the space
No one has seen
Towards the possibility

Your voice is heard
But my voice not carried to you
Diffusing tenderness
Image of the core

I'll sail for (I'll sail for)
I see beyond the world
My imagination is embodied
My deep mind (my deep mind)
My sense unites the world
Ideal vision is refined

I send a
I send a
I send a world
I send a world
I send a world

I'll sail

I'll sail for (I'll sail for)
I see beyond the world
My imagination is embodied
My deep mind (my deep mind)
My sense unites the world
Ideal vision is refined
