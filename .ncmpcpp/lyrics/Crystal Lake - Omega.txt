Thy will be praised for god has forsaken us all to die alone

Demolition
Annihilation
Fell from grace
We're condemned all along

Past to the present
We've tried to hold on
When future was there for ourselves to proclaim
Revolution? Evolution?
Mixed in with chaos and it's all the same
Times up
Windup
I've waited for so long
Round up
Sound off
With every breath we'll make them see
War is just a game
No use wasting time
We were born in this tragedy

Bringing back our system
Breaking down conviction
We are desire
We are the fire

Creators
Destroyers
They will abandoned us all to die alone

Truth so divine?
Further and further with chaos disorder
They say that god and the devil they see us the same
They love us and hate us for what we became

Bringing back our system
Breaking down conviction
We are desire
We are the fire

Demolition
Annihilation
Fell from grace were condemned all along

So this is a call to arms
We declare defiance in a form of knowledge
Our past
Their present
The future is ours to define
Destroy
Rebuild our past
Their present
The future
Our past
Their present
The future is ours to define
