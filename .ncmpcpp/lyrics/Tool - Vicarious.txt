Eye on the TV, 'cause tragedy thrills me
Whatever flavor it happens to be like
Killed by the husband, drowned by the ocean
Shot by his own son
She used a poison in his tea, then kissed him goodbye
That's my kind of story
It's no fun 'til someone dies

Don't look at me like I am a monster
Frown out your one face, but with the other
Stare like a junkie into the TV
Stare like a zombie
While the mother holds her child, watches him die
Hands to the sky, cryin' "Why, oh why?"

'Cause I need to watch things die
From a distance
Vicariously, I live while the whole world dies
You all need it too - don't lie

Why can't we just admit it?
Why can't we just admit it?
We won't give pause until the blood is flowing
Neither the brave nor bold, nor brightest of stories told
We won't give pause until the blood is flowing

I need to watch things die from a good safe distance
Vicariously, I live while the whole world dies
You all feel the same so
Why can't we just admit it?

Blood like rain come down
Drum on grave and ground
Part vampire, part warrior, carnivore and voyeur
Stare at the transmittal, sing to the death rattle

Credulous at best
Your desire to believe in angels in the hearts of the men
Pull your head on out, your hippy haze and give a listen
Shouldn't have to say it all again
The universe is hostile, so impersonal, devour to survive
So it is, so it's always been

We all feed on tragedy
It's like blood to a vampire
Vicariously, I live while the whole world dies
Much better you than I
