Through undergrowth she crawls
Weary feet, both hers and mine
Patience never fails
Still waiting on that hand of time
She's taught to understand
Never learned to comprehend
Patiently she leads me
Catch me weightless by her side

She breathes life to the heart of me
All of the worlds she's seen
Begging her please, oh, please
Let me breathe...

Where there's love, I'll feed it
It was all I needed
In her hands I'm healing
Where there's love I'll be...

Nestled in her skin
I fade to fragile in her hands
Let me stay a while
I see clearer through her eyes

She breathes life to the heart of me

Where there's love, I'll feed it
It was all I needed
In her hands I'm healing
Where there's love I'll be...
