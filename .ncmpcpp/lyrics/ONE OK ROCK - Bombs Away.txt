This is the end of you and me
And I'm never going back
Before my broken soul begins
To fade to black

And if I could show you now
Let you see the future
Burning out, burning out
This is confirmation

The higher up I get
I bury it, bury it
The higher up I get

Tick tick tock and it's bombs away
Come on, it's the only way
Save yourself for a better day
No, no, we are falling down
I know, you know this is over
Tick tick tock and it's bombs away
Now we're falling… now we're falling down

つけいる術なくただ立ち尽くした
叫ぶ声むなしく to fade to black
エグられた感情に 痛みも 涙も
Burning out, burning out
This is confirmation

The higher up I get
I bury it, bury it
The higher up I get

Tick tick tock and it's bombs away
Come on, it's the only way
Save yourself for a better day
No, no, we are falling down
I know, you know this is over
Tick tick tock and it's bombs away
Now we're falling, now we're falling down

Singing loud so I can hear
In my head, in my head
I'm feeling restless
Hanging by a broken thread
In my head, in my head, in my head

Singing loud so I can hear
In my head, in my head
I'm feeling restless
Hanging by a broken thread
In my head, in my head, in my head

Tick tick tock and it's bombs away
Come on, it's the only way
Save yourself for a better day
No, no, we are falling down
I know, you know this is over
Tick tick tock and it's bombs away
Now we're falling, now we're falling down

Tick tick tock and it's bombs away
Tick tick tock and it's bombs away
Tick tick tock and it's bombs away
