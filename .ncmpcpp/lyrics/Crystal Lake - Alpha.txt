With Light, we have become darkness
Heaven above's forsaken the outspoken and vanquished our ambitions
Destroy the past and rebuild the present
The future is ours to define
Don't fall asleep into their dream to watch our world falling down on its knees
I'll wake you up into a sound that echoes off into our common ground
Our past
Their present
The future is ours to define
