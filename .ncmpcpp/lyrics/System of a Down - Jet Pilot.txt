Wired were the eyes of a horse on a jet pilot
One that smiled when he flew over the bay
Wired were the eyes of a horse on a jet pilot
One that smiled when he flew over the bay

My horse
Is a shackled old man
His, his remorse
Was that he couldn't survey
The skies right before
Right before they went gray
My horse and my remorse
Flying over a great bay

Wired were the eyes of a horse on a jet pilot
One that smiled when he flew over the bay
Wired were the eyes of a horse on a jet pilot
One that smiled when he flew over the bay

My source
Is the source of all creation
Her discourse
Is that we all don't survey
The skies right before
Right before they go gray
My source and my remorse
Flying over a great bay

One that smiled when he flew over the bay
Wired were the eyes of a horse on a jet pilot
One that smiled when he flew over the bay
Where were the eyes of a horse on a jet pilot
One that smiled when he flew over the bay
Where were the eyes of a horse on a jet pilot
One that smiled when he flew over the bay

Wired were the eyes of a horse on a jet pilot
One that smiled when he flew over the bay
Wired were the eyes of a horse on a jet pilot
One that smiled when he flew over the bay
