Zomba, Zomba, now you wanna come and get some
Zomba, Zomba, well, say no more

Get on the floor, get on the floor
Initiation just began for servants loyal to the purpose
Earn respect, that's well deserved
And follow me to the dark side

Dance in the pit and hail to the fire, minions
Prove yourself if you wanna get some, minions
Dance in the pit and hail to the fire

Zomba, Zomba, so now you wanna come and get some
Zomba, Zomba, well, say no more

Cleans down your soul, keep anger in, stored
Fools are enslaved by the self-involved
Faking smiles for ill desires
They're ignorant beings with no sense of shame

Earn respect, that's well deserved
Earn respect, that's well deserved

Get on the floor, get on the floor
Initiation just began for servants loyal to the purpose
Earn respect, that's well deserved
And follow me to the dark side

Dance in the pit and hail to the fire, minions
Prove yourself if you wanna get some, minions
Dance in the pit and hail to the fire

Zomba, Zomba, so now you wanna come and get some
Zomba, Zomba, well, say no more

Dance in the pit and hail to the fire
Dance in the pit and hail to the fire

This is initiation
Just rethink why you're doing this
If you want some
Come get some, motherfucker

Zomba, Zomba, so now you wanna come and get some
Zomba, Zomba, dance in the pit and hail to the fire
Zomba, Zomba, prove yourself if you wanna get some
Zomba, Zomba, well, say no more

Minions
Prove yourself if you wanna get some
Minions
Well, say no more
