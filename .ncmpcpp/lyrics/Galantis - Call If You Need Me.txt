We go forever running
Deep blue in the go
Feel so close to falling
We go forever running
Deep blue in the go
Feel so close to falling
You're more than you know

Burn, bright, firefly
So called do or die
We go forever running

Hold on to what you've got
Let go of what you're not
Hold on to what you've got
Living it easy
Call if you need me
Living it easy
Call if you need me
Living it easy
Call if you need me

We go silver surfing
We chat in the night
Sunrise early morning
And flow as you like

Burn, bright, firefly
So called do or die
We go forever running

Hold on to what you've got
Let go of what you're not
Hold on to what you've got
Living it easy
Call if you need me
Living it easy
Call if you need me
Living it easy
Call if you need me
