I got two letters from you
Last words of the runaway
Your love was written so true
And now I can't speak your name

I faced destruction and you
Just killed me and walked away
I gave my heart to the cruel
Now it will not beat again

I hope you do
I hope you suffer
I hope you do
I hope you suffer
I hope you do
I hope you suffer
I hope you do
Just like I've suffered

No one will ever know you
Deny the last one who cares
Intoxicate with the new
Pretend I'm no longer here

I opened my heart to you
You lied just to reach inside
Now with the faith you removed
Our hope for forgiveness dies

I hope you do
I hope you suffer
I hope you do
I hope you suffer
I hope you do
I hope you suffer
I hope you do
Just like I've suffered


I've seen my darkest days (Ah, ah)
You gave each one to me (Ah, ah)

I've seen my darkest days (Ah, ah)
You gave each one to me (Ah, ah)

You have been lost for days (Ah, ah)
May you find my darkness

I hope you do
I hope you suffer
I hope you do
I hope you suffer
I hope you do
I hope you suffer
I hope you do

Just like I
I fucking suffered
Just like you
You made me suffer
I hope you
I hope you do
