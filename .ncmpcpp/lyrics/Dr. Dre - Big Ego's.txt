I got mo' class than most of them, ran with the best of them
Forgave the less of 'em and blazed at the rest of them
What can I say? Cal-i-for-ni-a
Where niggas die every day over some shit they say
Disconnected from the streets forever
As long as I got a Beretta, nigga, I'm down for whatever
I roll with my shit off safety, for niggas that been hating me lately
And the bitches that wanna break me
If Cali blew up, I'd be in the Aftermath
Bumping gangsta rap shit, down to blast for cash
'Cause from Eazy-E, to D.O.C., to D.P.G.
Started from that S.O.B., D.R.E.
Like Dub-C I'm rich rolling, pistol holding
Pockets swole nigga, that's how I'm rolling
Put the flame to the killer nigga
Worldwide homicide mob figure in the building, for real
I'm hitting switches, making bitches eat bitches
See me grab my dick every time I pose for pictures
I own acres, floor seats watching the Lakers
I'm cool with eses who got AK's in cases

Knoc-turn'al:
Dedicated to all of those with big egos
Never faking, we get the dough and live legal
Haters hate this, we sip the Mo' and yank the Heezos
Niggas play this in their Rovers, Jeeps and Regals
Dedicated to all of those with big egos
Never faking, we get the dough and live legal
Haters hate this, we sip the Mo' and yank the Heezos
Bitches play this in their Benzes, Jeeps and Geos

Hittman:
I'll bust a Mr.Toughy, slash a Smoovy Doovy
Crashin' Flex on Tuesday's, harassing hoes at movies
Passing by with Uzis, like who you aiming at?
That shady bitch and that bitch nigga that was claiming that, rat-a-tat-tat

I don't sympathize for wack hoes and wimpy guys
You gotta recognize Hittman is an enterprise
Cali pride, Bronson rider South Central-ised
The Henny got me energized, smoke the guys
Tryna focus on mines, poke they eyes out, I'm L.A.'s loc'est
Hope they don't have to find out the hard way
Like snitch niggas in the pen that get hit when the guards look the other way
We hitting hard, Hittman and Dre
You playing games? I suggest you know the rules
We putting guns to fools, make you run yo' jewels
Take yo honey and cruise to the snooty and snooze, cop booze
Pop coochie till the nut oozes, you shouldn't fuck with crews
That's sick, the Aftermath is we rule shit
I'm Big Hit, don't confuse me with no other 'bout to blow, motherfucker

You look like AC Green
Bitch don't call here anymore
With feet like Ben Vereen's
Bitch don't call here anymore
No, no, no, no

Hittman:
What up? It's Hittman
I ain't at the crib right now
So you can leave your name and number after the beep
Unless it's Tammy's ugly ass, I ain't fucking with you
