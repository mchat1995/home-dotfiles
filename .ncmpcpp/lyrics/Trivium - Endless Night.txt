Is it a sin to miss the hell
That you survived with best of friends
At worst of times?
I never got the answer

They never told me, if you're not careful
What doesn't kill you can control you
Now it defines me and it reminds me
That it will never let me go

If we share the pain
Then maybe we won't have to bury memories away

I try to change but the dawn escapes again
I fight another endless night

When it gets dark, I cannot breathe
It's only the sound of grinding teeth
Afraid of the silence
And its lurking violence

Your empty words, the feigned concern
We go through the motions, I never return
'Cause it still defines me and it reminds me
That it will never let me go

If we share the pain
Then maybe we won't have to bury memories away

I try to change but the dawn escapes again
I fight another endless night
I try to change but the dawn escapes again
I fight another endless night

I try to change but the dawn escapes again
I fight another endless night

Is it a sin to miss the hell
That you survived with best of friends
At worst of times?
I fight another endless night

I try to change but the dawn escapes again
I fight another endless night

When it gets dark, I cannot breathe
It's only the sound of grinding teeth
Afraid of the silence
I fight another endless night
