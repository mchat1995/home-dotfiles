I thought you said you'd never leave
I think back as I took a puff
Know what happens every time you wanna leave
Always come back 'cause you wanna fuck
Always come back 'cause you wanna fuss
Holdin' back, ain't no turnin' back when you fall in love
Know what happens every time you speed
Always fall flat 'cause you wanna rush
So we could take it slow
Separate the highs from the lows
Separate the evens from the odds
I just hope you put me back together when I come apart

I come apart, and you keep it together
I come apart, and I can't stand the pressure
In all your grace and fire for me, that I cannot compare
I come apart, this can't last forever
Can't last forever...

I woke up today high
Felt a little less pressure from you
And I'm here to say I
Make it even under lessons from me
If you find a way to fight the pain which we endure
If you fly away then rest assured...

I come apart, and you keep it together
I come apart, and I can't stand the pressure
In all your grace and fire for me, that I cannot compare
I come apart, this can't last forever
Can't last forever...

You're the eye, but I'm tearing all the time
Always there to catch me, but I'm never coming down
Reconstructing all the pieces I left in my way
I guess you know, in control
Chaos I create
I come apart...

You made a bet with me, now you're in debt with me
Made my bed, lied in it, then you slept with me
It's ruthless, she the closest thing next to me
The truth is, that she blew it and you left with me
Especially hard to express to me
European attitude but born in West Philly
She just have a smokin' 'gina, where the Wet Willies?
I come apart, I'm in her heart on the left titty

I come apart, and you keep it together
I come apart, and I can't stand the pressure
In all your grace and fire for me, that I cannot compare
I come apart, this can't last forever
Can't last forever...
