Pull the top down, use your knees to drive
I'll make it worth your while, just let me taste the sky
You pressed your mouth on mine and fed me a star
And said, "We never can truly know who we are"

Know who we are

With the lights out and the night inside
The broken radio was playing suicide
I felt myself falling, I confessed to you
"I saw a body," you said you'd seen a few

This night has only just begun
If there's discretion that you've not abandoned, now's the time
We'll burn to best the morning's sun
Go grab your bag, I'll bring the gun, the gun

Keep the top down, use your knees to drive
I'll hide these words, they're only yours to find
You pressed your mouth on mine and said they'd call us stars
Then said, "We never can truly know who we are"

This night has only just begun
If there's discretion that you'd not abandon, now's the time
We'll burn to best the morning's sun
Go grab your bag, I'll bring the gun

Everything was burning bright, everyone was frightened
You said, "Stay strong"
Everybody knowing that what we'd invited still
Remains when we're gone

This night has only just begun
If there's discretion that you'd not abandon, now's the time
We'll burn to best the morning's sun
Go grab your bag, I'll bring the gun, oh

This night has only just begun
If there's discretion that you'd not abandon, now's the time
We'll burn to best the morning's sun
Go grab your bag, I'll bring the gun, the gun
I'll bring the gun
