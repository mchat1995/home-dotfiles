There were girls on boys, there were girls on girls
Red heels on a table, in a champagne blur
It all gets kinda hazy when your heart's fucked up
We were emptying bottles, we were pushing our luck

And it turned it to the longest night of our whole damn lives
At the wildest times our whole

It all started with girls on boys, girls on girls
Red heels on a table and I didn't care
It all gets kinda hazy when your heart's fucked up
I got high to forget you, I got high real hard
It all started with a broken heart

It all started with girls on boys
It all started with a broken heart

No, you wouldn't come home, so I stayed up
Oh, then I wouldn't see you with someone in the cold
It's all kinda empty, so I filled it with rum
It was stupid and crazy, I was comfortably numb

It turned it to the longest night of our whole damn lives
At the wildest times our whole

It all started with girls on boys, girls on girls
Red heels on a table and I didn't care
It all gets kinda hazy when your heart's fucked up
I got high to forget you, I got high real hard
It all started with a broken heart

It all started with girls on boys
Girls on boys
It all started with girls on boys
Girls on girls
Red heels on a table and I didn't care
It all gets kinda hazy when your heart's fucked up
I got high to forget you, I got high real hard

It all started with a broken heart
