Bugzy malone
You know

Let me help you get into the zone like alize red
I put the chrome to his dome like A.S.A.P said

You are now listening to the journal of an evil genius

Listen to the words
Watch this

Now I'm that buggy malone
Life can get colourful in the daytime
Bitches always trying to catch me slipping on the FaceTime
3 years deep, so I never let it phase me
Now I don't want to whipe my babies I just heard that through grapevine
I keep pretty ones around for when its playtime
Kanye West told me to never be a goldmine
Now they want to take a picture in my t-shirts to get back at their ex boyfriend now thats a straight crime
Now your listening to the newest kind of crook
Catch me listening to brother lynch chonged, baging up
I'm done fucking with the white and green, I know the truth hurts
But now I'm bagging up my turn into the devil t shirts
Selling out quicker, than a O.Z of blue cheese
Who knew I could make money watching movies
I watched scarface new jack city and kill bill reminiscing, sitting swigging alize blue
This is the, journal of an evil genius part one
I'd love to be a nobody but now I'm too far gone
They use to laugh now they want to photograph the t-shirts sold out twice tell a nigga do the maths up
We be on building up that empire don shit
Ive fallen out with friends that I've been friends with the longest
And anybody fucking with the team or questioning my legacy
I guarantee I knock them unconscious
Now catch me on a late night listening to French Montana
Rolling passive cause I'm banned cutting through the manor
I remember having no clothes and being blackouted
But since I got sponsorship the wardrobes packed out
Its like I see the whole world in black and white
I'm not the joker but you can catch me on a dark night
On a rooftop overlooking all the streetlights
And now they say the cites mine so I'm just trying to be polite
The future used to look bleak, now its looking kinda bright
I remember being on the road just high as a kite
Fuck a street fight I was on the butterfly knife nino brown shit but don't call me wesley snipes
Jakes see me on my peddle bike rolling with my Pitbull hat down low looking like bill sykes
Cause I'm a straight up villain no one can see my vision because I'm too clever for the bad boys in my division
This is straight up mafia music and if you got a bass box nigga than use it
Let me help you get into the zone like alize red
I put the chrome to his dome like A.S.A.P said
I'm just trying to be notorious like biggie isn't dead
And make changes like 2Pac didn't get shot in the chest
I'm the newest, the wickedest and the very best
I'm just trying to take over the world
Because I'm the evil genius
