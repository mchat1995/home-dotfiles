I don't believe that I can stay here
And watch them vilify my blood
I don't believe that you are with me
It's so beneath you, gazing up

I won't kneel
I won't bow
If you're there now
Strike me down, strike me down, strike me down
Oh, you've got nothing

There is none higher than this blood
And I won't serve anyone
No there is nothing above
And I don't serve anyone, anyone

There's nothing above

Deep in my heart, a disbeliever
Only inviting in the truth
You're in my heart, my disbeliever
As holy horror crushes you

I won't kneel
I won't bow
No one is there to
Strike me down, strike me down, strike me down
Except the faithful

There is none higher than this blood
And I won't serve anyone
No there is nothing above
And I don't serve anyone, anyone

I don't believe that I can stay here
And watch them vilify my blood
I don't believe that I can stay here
And watch them vilify your love, my love

I won't kneel
I won't bow
If you're there god
Strike me down, strike me down
You won't

There is none higher than this blood
And I won't serve anyone
No there is nothing above
And I don't serve anyone, anyone

There's nothing above
