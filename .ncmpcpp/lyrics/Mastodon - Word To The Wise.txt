Diamond in the wishing well 
Fallen underneath its spell 
Save me from the wicked ways 
Pulling me with all its weight

High above the silver line 
Flying over burning ground 
Ringing bells with golden chains 
Resonating with the sound

Siren sounded 
I couldn't hear it

Travel deep within the mind 
Never want to cross the line 
Found the one I'd never sell 
One I thought I'd never find

Searching through the layers of filth 
Feeling where the light is from 
Always licking off the bone 
Carve a way to our home

Siren sounded 
I didn't hear it 
Voices warned 
I'd not heed it

I fell into a pit of lies 
I tried to dig around the other side 
And much to my surprise 
I was to blame for all the rain

I fell into a pit of lies 
I tried to dig around the other side 
And much to my surprise 
I was to blame for all the rain 
I was to blame for all the rain
