The enemy has come for you
Hear the pounding thunder hooves
There's not time to run or hide
Draw the weapon from your side

When they ride out
From morning mist
With sharp blades in mighty fists
One hundred warriors on horse
An awesome brutal force

You feel weak and scared
Fear has gripped your heart
You will soon be overrun
You will soon be torn apart!

Now, where is your god?
Does he hear your prayers?
Does he even care for you?
His silence speaks loud and clear

Raid is done!
See the country burn
All are gone!
Only misery remains
Raid is done!
The warriors return
All are gone!
And all that's left is pain

The vikings strike
So fast and hard
Those who run won't make it far
And those who choose
To stand and fight
They have made the choice to die

The weapons tear
Through flesh and bone
Dying men that scream and moan
With severed limbs
To the hall of death

The battlefield is full of death
Feel the stench of rotting flesh
When the entire country burns
As the warriors return

And they came out
From morning mist
With sharp blades in mighty fists
They leave this land
All burned and scorn
Those alive will mourn

Now, where is your god?
Does he hear your prayers?
Does he even care for you?
His silence speaks loud and clear

Raid is done!
See the country burn
All are gone!
Only misery remains
Raid is done!
The warriors return
All are gone!
And all that's left is pain
Raid is done (see the country burn)
Only misery remains
And all are gone (warriors return)
All that's left is pain
Where's your god? (Does he hear your prayers?)
Does he even care?
Where's your god? (Does he hear your prayers?)
A silence loud and clear
