Hey...

I know what I came to do, and that ain't gonna change,
So go ahead and talk your talk, 'cause I won't take the bait...
I'm over here doing what I like, I'm over here working day and night,
And if my real ain't real enough, I'm sorry for you, bae...

Let's find a light inside our universe now
Where ain't nobody keep on holding us down...
Just come and get it, let them say what they say,
'Cause I'm about to put them all away...

Focus on me! Fu-fu-focus on me! Ooh!
Focus on me! Fu-fu-focus on me! Ooh!
Focus on me! (Focus...) Fu-fu-focus on me! (Focus on me...) Ooh!
Focus on me! (Focus...) Fu-fu-focus on me! (Focus on me...) Ooh!

I can tell you're curious, it's written on your lips;
Ain't no need to hold it back - go 'head and talk your shit... (Hey...)
I know you're hopin' that I'll react (No...), I know you're hopin' I'm looking back,
But if my real ain't real enough, then I don't know what is...

Let's find a light inside our universe now
Where ain't nobody keep on holding us down... (They won't keep on holdin' us down...)
Just come and get it, let them say what they say,
'Cause I'm about to put them all away...

Focus on me! (Hey!) Fu-fu-focus on me! (Me...) Ooh!
Focus on me! (Oh...) Fu-fu-focus on me! Ooh!
Focus on me! (Focus...) Fu-fu-focus on me! (Focus on me...) Ooh!
Focus on me! (Focus...) Fu-fu-focus on me! (Focus on me...) Ooh!

One, two, three - come on, girls.

(Hey!) You know I like it...
(Hey!) Ba-da-ba-ba, ba-da-da-da, da...
(Focus on me!) Come on, now... now!
(Focus on me!) Oh, oh, yeah...

Let's find a light inside our universe now (They won't find us...)
Where ain't nobody keep on holdin' us down... (They won't keep on holdin' us down...)
Just come and get it, let them say what they say; (Let 'em say what they say!)
'Cause I'm about to put them all away... 

Focus on me! [Whoo! Hey!] Fu-fu-focus on me! Ooh! [You know I like it when you focus on me...]
