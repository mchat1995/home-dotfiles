You and I will last forever
 But there are many reasons why I can not stay
 Now we shall meet again in heaven
 Going out to war is never easy that is true
 Another day, another life I may not have to sacrifice
 The only good thing in my life

 A battle cry, a soldier's sigh, I wish I hadn't say goodbye
 This time I won't be coming home
 In the heat of the fight I search for the light
 A rainbow is painting the sky
 I am destined now to die

 I'm here to march against the force of evil
 Here to die in the pouring rain
 But just as sure as Rome is falling
 I'll be rising again
 I will return as a new believer
 Here to conquer the walls of pain
 And just as sure as Rome is falling
 I'll be rising again

 Now I'm writing you this letter
 But I'm not sure if you will ever see these words

 Another day, another life I may not have to sacrifice
 But I'm still aiming for the sky
 In this suburb to hell I'm living to tell
 About how I defended my Rome
 Hail the Caesar
 Kingdom come
