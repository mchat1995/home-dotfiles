Fading out your memories from the vision
Pulling off the picture away from mirror
Still you wait for the chance
For me to share our time we had
But what will be for you
I know same results will break us down

Help me out, inside of me
Just take on to find your way
All you want is to stay along
But we stand too far

Falling out pieces you'll never find one
I know what you are looking for
Trying to find a reason you can pull me over
You just listen what they say
Creeping shadow right behind me
You know I'll turn my head away
I will never let you down
You know what I feel

Help me out, inside of me
Just take on to find your way
All you want is to stay along
But we stand too far

It's like a reflection, like a reflection
In my heart, just keep on bleeding
I can't stand myself too long

Like a reflection, it's like a reflection
Don't you ever say your words
We had enough, we can take it over

It's like a reflection, like a reflection
In my heart, just keep on bleeding
I can't stand myself too long

Like a reflection, it's like a reflection
In my heart, just keep on bleeding
I can't stand myself too long

Like a reflection, it's like a reflection
Don't you ever say your words
We had enough, we can take it over
