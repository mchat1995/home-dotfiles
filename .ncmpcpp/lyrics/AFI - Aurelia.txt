Aurelia, the new wolves await
Aurelia, they brought you new change
They're barking in the wrong key
They're barking in the wrong key
They're barking in the wrong key
And you sing along

Aurelia, dream animals' wills
Are real enough to make the slow kill
They're barking in the wrong key
They're barking in the wrong key
They're barking in the wrong key
And you sing along

Can you see at night?
We can see at night
Can you see at night?
We can see at night
And we're barking in the wrong key
They're barking in the wrong key
They're barking in the wrong key
And you sing along
And you sing along
And you sing along
They're barking in the wrong key
And you sing along
