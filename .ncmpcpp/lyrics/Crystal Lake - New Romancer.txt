Bring it back down!!

We are back again
This is the beginning
Lamentation from this contamination
Is not the way of our purification
We'll open the sky
So wait for the sign
This moment is near
When these two worlds collide
There is no justice in this world
Cause they're preaching the dogma "2 plus 2 makes 5"
We've returned to take the throne
We're breaking every silence
That you control
We are the new romancers
On broken glass we dance
In the state of trance
It's a brave new world
It's time to open up your eyes
We're waking up your mind
So open your up your eyes
Be the truth within their lies
They will cloud your mind
Believe me when I say
They'll blind your fact to fiction
It's truly time to free ourselves
From these "lies in the soul"
We are the sign
We are the light
Raise your heads high as we march through the night
We are the sign
We are the light
Through chaos disorder
We build from the ground
Cause this is the end: the end of the start
We are the voice of this new generation
It's time to open up your eyes
We're waking up your mind
So open your up your eyes
Be the truth within their lies
They will cloud your mind
