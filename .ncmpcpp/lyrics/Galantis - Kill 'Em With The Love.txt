It's in the whispers of my allergy
It's in my heart, it's in my soul
It's in my make believe of geometry
It's in the stories I've been told

When you've tried it all but it ain't enough
When you can't give up cause you love being young
Believe
I've got a message for y'all

Kill 'em with the love, strobe lights above
They can't keep all our hearts in jail now
Kill 'em with the love, strobe lights above
They can't keep all our hearts in jail now
Can't keep all our hearts in jail now
Kill 'em with the love
Kill 'em with the love

It's all we know, it's all we care about
The compass is left at home
It's all we see, it's all we hearing now
A hungry heart is to be told

When you've tried it all but it ain't enough
When you can't give up cause you love being young
Believe
I've got a message for y'all

Kill 'em with the love, strobe lights above
They can't keep all our hearts in jail now
Kill 'em with the love, strobe lights above
They can't keep all our hearts in jail now
Can't keep all our hearts in jail now
Kill 'em with the love
Kill 'em with the love
