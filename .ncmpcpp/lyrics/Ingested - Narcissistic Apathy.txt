Kill the weak, enslave the strong.
If one resists, then kill them all.
Except for you, you stand and watch,
The rape and purging of your flock.

The only true commandment, thou shall kill for pleasure.
This feeling so primeval, be an evil they can't measure.

I've heard the word of God, He has abandoned you.
Remove your flesh to start afresh and be reborn anew.

I am the word of God.

Now you fucking crawl, give me what is mine.
Heroes rise and fall, yet I'm carved into time
.
I'm carved into time.

Devouring the contents of our enemy's skulls I know everything they know I inherit their souls. 
Not hesitation but austere, they cut themselves from ear to ear, 
Their gaze is never broken.

Devouring the contents of our enemy's skulls I know everything they know I inherit their souls. 
Not hesitation but austere, they cut themselves from ear to ear, 
Their gaze is never broken, you will watch them, bleeding, choking.

Payback for the bullshit piled on over years,
Corpses cannot worship and the dead have no one to fear.

The dead have, no one, to, fear.

And if the human race had one fucking neck, I'd have my hands around it.
And if the human race had one fucking neck, I'd have my hands around it.

Payback for the bullshit piled on over years,
Corpses cannot worship and the dead have no one to fear.

If every single person that you see deserves to die,
Murder them in public there's no prophet to defy.
These verses are delivered with utter sincerity,
I envision a dead world free from prosperity.

And if the human race had one fucking neck, I'd have my hands around it.
I've heard the word of God, He has abandoned you.
Remove your flesh to start afresh and be reborn anew.

I am the word of God.
