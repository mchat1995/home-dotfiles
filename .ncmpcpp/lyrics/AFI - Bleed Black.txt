I am exploring the inside
I find it desolate
I do implore these confines
Now as they penetrate, recreate me

I'm hovering throughout time
I crumble in these days
I crumble, cannot, I cannot find 
Reflection in these days

If you listen, listen, listen
Listen close, beat by beat
You can hear when the heart stops, I saved the pieces
When it broke, and ground them all to dust

I am destroyed by the inside
I disassociate
Hope to destroy the outside
It will alleviate, elevate me

Like water flowing into lungs
I'm flowing through these days
Like morphine cuts through, through deadened veins
I'm numbing in these days

So, if you listen, listen, listen
Listen close, beat by beat
You can hear when the heart stops, I saved the pieces
When it broke, and ground them all to dust

I know what died that night
It can never be brought back to life
Once again, I know

I know what died that night
It can never be brought back to life
Once again, I know

I know I died that night 
And I'll never be brought back to life
Once again, I know

I know I died that night 
And I'll never be brought back to life
Once again, I know

If you listen, listen, listen
Listen close, beat by beat
You can hear when the heart stops, I saved the pieces
When it broke, and ground them all to dust

So, if you listen, listen, listen
Listen close, beat by beat
You can hear when the heart stops, I saved the pieces
When it broke, and ground them all to dust
