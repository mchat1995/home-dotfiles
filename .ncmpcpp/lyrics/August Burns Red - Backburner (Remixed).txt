Convictions to the back burner [x2]

Remembering what's really,
Important isn't so important after all.

Gather all your possessions,
Smile because you've got it all [x2]

Wah!

Smile because you've got it all [x2]

Still that empty feeling won't go away (Won't go away) [x2]

Your puzzle's missing,
One very essential piece (Essential Piece)
Keep looking in all the wrong places until it's too late (Until it's too late)

Slip on the ice again.
When did you become so cold?

Living for the here and now never made so much
So much sense.

Slip on the ice again.
When did you become so cold?

You think you've got all the time in the world,
But this could all be ending... Now!

[Break Down]

How far down will you go
Before it's too late?
Slipping on the ice again,
You've become so cold.

Lucky for you rock bottom is in sight [x2]

Your wake up call is set for now,
And the trail you have followed has come
All the way to the end.

Oh!

I hope you survive,
Survive the crash.
