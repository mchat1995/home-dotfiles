I watched you go out the door
With poison I've seen before
I saw you shine, you shine

I collapse to the floor
It promised it'd miss me more
And said true love, is mine

I missed you, did you miss me?

Slowly it's come to leave me
Deliver the deed
I can't take this deeper panic
Teach me, teach me not to dream
Dream deeply

I haven't left you for days
My panic keeps me awake
As he unwinds, inside

He told me I should have known
That he'd hated the way I'd grown
To love some eyes, she lied

Do you miss her like I missed you?

Slowly it's come to leave me
Deliver the deed
I can't take this deeper panic
Teach me, teach me not to dream

Dream deeply


Slowly it's come to leave me
Deliver the deed
I can't take this deeper panic
Teach me, teach me not to dream

Dream deeply

Slowly I swallowed your fears
Throughout all those years
I've heard you let them consume me
Teach me, teach me how you sleep

So Sweetly

Slowly, it's come to leave me
Deliver the deed
I can't take this deeper panic
Teach me, teach me how you sleep

So sweetly
