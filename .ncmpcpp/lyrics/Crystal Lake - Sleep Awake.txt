My eyes, my eyes
My eyes are open wide
Wake up, wake up
Wake me up from the inside

Let yourself free your mind

I think I'm 'bout to drown
Keeping me unconscious
The weight keeps pulling me deeper
And deeper down
The shadow of the sun
A mother of the night
Hypnos signs to me
A lullaby of the ancient times

My eyes, my eyes
My eyes are open wide
Wake up, wake up
Wake me up from the inside

We are sleeping awake
We're awake
We are dreaming awake
We're awake

Free your mind now
Do not let yourself drown
Just free your mind

We are the prisoners of our mind
Prisoners of our mind

Show me a sign
Show me a sign
Show me a sign of reality
Its brought you to your knees
Fight back from this disease
Wake up wake up
A death sentence of misery
Wake up wake up
Show me a sign of reality
