We run to the place of our dreams
Grasping the meaning of life
As we breathe
And the times that we shared
Linger now and forever

We run to the place of our dreams
Grasping the meaning of life
As we breathe
And the times that we shared
Linger now and forever

We run to the glorious dreams
Following your steady sound
Powerfully
And the melody carved
In our hearts now and forever

We run to the glorious dreams
Following your steady sound powerfully
And the memory carved
Warming our hearts forever

Heavy rain and sunshine we walked through
We cherish your dream and make it true
Although time is not coming back

We run to the place of our dreams
Grasping the meaning of life
As we breathe
And the times that we shared
Linger now and forever

Heavy rain and sunshine we walked through
We cherish your dream and make it true
Although time is not coming back
