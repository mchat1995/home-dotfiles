Sorry I ain't got no money
I'm not trying to be funny
But I left it all at home today
You can call me what you wanna
I ain't giving you a dollar
This time I ain't gonna run away
You might knock me down
You might knock me down
But I will get back up again
You can call it how you wanna
I ain't giving you a dollar
This time I ain't gonna run away

This time
This time
This time
This time I ain't gonna run
Not this time
Not this time
Not this time

Not this time
