We dream of places we can't get to
We crawl we swim it's neverending
The crests of tidal waves are raging
The bitter lake is ever changing
A conscious ocean covered planet
Of memories flooding back to drown me
Uncertain lost in deep confusion
Is this the past that's passing through me?

Close your eyes
Stand your ground
Face the wind
Never looking back

The ancient prophecy unfolded
Distracted minds ignored the warnings
Confronting facts to prove the fiction
Right to the point of mass extinction
We flirted with the edge of darkness

Offered ourselves unto the harvest
The shepherd led, we blindly followed
Into the world of no tomorrow

Break me down to pieces
And strip me of my freedom
I fall back on my instincts
But never know the reason why
All hope disappearing
Gives the power of healing
I'll walk among the breathing
But never understand what it means

We need a story to believe in
We need a hero to prevail

Our design shifted frame by frame
Across the line our cycle starts to fail
Our design shifted frame by frame
Across the line we die to live again

Close your eyes
Stand your ground
Face the wind
Don't look back
Lift your sails to ascend
Find the strength within yourself

Close your eyes
Stand your ground
Face the wind
Don't look back
Lift your sails to ascend
See this through until the end

We need a story to believe in
We need a hero to prevail
We need a challenge we can overcome
It takes a tragedy to make us one
