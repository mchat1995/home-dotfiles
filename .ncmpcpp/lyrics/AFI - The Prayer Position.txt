Now, peel off the skin
Back from the flesh
Steal all the flesh back
From the starving static minds
From nature we must stray
To clarity we'll climb

Deadly impulse
Seems so natural
Just look beyond it and we'll find
(We will find)

(A brand new evolution, here begins a brand new line)

And in the distance, there's a gathering
That no longer seems so far away

Pushed to our knees so let us pray (Let us pray)
And all together
We'll bring the real rain
Watch all that's wasted wash away (Wash, wash away)
So let it come
Our will be done

Stature retrieved
Regain our form
Break free from instinct
That's left us all confined
From nature we must stray
To clarity we'll climb

Tradition ingrained now
Impermissible
Now comes a call for all to find
(We will find)

(A brand new evolution, here begins a brand new line)

And in the distance, there's a gathering
That no longer seems so far away

Pushed to our knees so let us pray (Let us pray)
And all together
We'll bring the real rain
Watch all that's wasted wash away (Wash, wash away)
So let it come
Our will be done

I can't help but fear
Look to my species and tremble
To think that God is just
God!

And in the distance, there's a gathering
That no longer seems so far away

Pushed to our knees so let us pray (Let us pray, we're praying)
And all together
We'll bring the real rain
Watch all that's wasted wash away (Wash, wash away)
So let it come
Our will be done
