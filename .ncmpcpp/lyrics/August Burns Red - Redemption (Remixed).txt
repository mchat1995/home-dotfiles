I trust in You for life to live
And air to breath, purity fills my lungs

I trust in You for life to live
And air to breath, purity fills my lungs

I no longer live in solitude
No longer bound
My heart beats with great devotion
This is the start to a new beginning

I no longer live in solitude
No longer bound
My heart beats with great devotion
This is the start to a new beginning

On my knees praying for mercy
Hands raised high, humble and broken

Wanting Your grace
Wanting your security
Memories of laying facedown
Motionless with such a hollow feeling inside
Soon I would end this life I was living

I am just a man
With a heart and sinful hands
I am a fallen victim

I am just a man
With a heart and sinful hands
I am a fallen victim

I am just a man
With a heart and sinful hands
I am a fallen victim

I am just a man
With a heart and sinful hands
I am a fallen victim

Lord show me the way
Let my words be Your words
Let my thoughts be Your thoughts
Let my words be Your words
Lord show me the way

I ask of You, Father
To You I give You my praise
To You I give You my praise
To You I give You my praise

Show me the way
Take me in Your arms
Never let me go

I trust in You, I trust in You
For life to live, for life to live
And air to breath, air to breath
Purity filled my lungs

Lord, show me the way
As I give myself to You
Never let me go
Hold me with Your everlasting love
Be my strength, be my voice, my glory
Set me free
