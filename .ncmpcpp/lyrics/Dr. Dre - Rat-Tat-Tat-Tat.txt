Olunda:
You really don't understand, do you?
Hey man, don't you realize in order for us to make this thing work, man
We gotta get rid of the pimps and the pushers and the prostitutes and then start all over again clean

RBX:
Nigga, is you crazy?
Once again, the mighty Death Row organization committin' mass murder, and we ain't askin' for shit, nigga
We takin' it
So Dre, blast they ass, nigga

Dr. Dre and Snoop Dogg:
Rat-tat-tat-tat late at night with my gat
On the streets of LA, wonderin' where the pussy at
Straight player, looking for a ho
Hangin' out, rollin' in my '64
Sixteen switches for the niggas in my hood
Seventeen shells so I make it understood
Stay back, lay back, way back in the cut
You come outside nigga you gettin' fucked up
But I told ya, creep, creep ya best move
Like Luther Vandross, fuckin' up the west coast
I'm right back up in ya when ya nut
One, two, three, nut, from the D-R-E but
This is for the hoes that I used to know
When I didn't have my '64 and a lot of dough
I keep ya this and like that and I
(Never hesitate to put a nigga on his back)

Rat-tat-tat-tat tat ta tat like that and I
(Never hesitate to put a nigga on his back)
Rat-tat-tat-tat tat ta tat like that and I
(Never hesitate to put a nigga on his back)

Oh wait, that's that nigga that owe you that grip
(Yeah, there that fool is)
(Break him off proper then)
What's up, what's happenin'?
I'm the man, what's up?
Nigga, you delinquent, can I get those in?
(Nigga, pay this nigga here)
(What's up? I ain't got yo' money)
Well, yo, check this out, nigga
(What's up?)
(What's up?)
(What's up?)
Yeah motherfucker
(I'll be back, dog, I'll be back)
Yeah, you ain't never comin' back, fool

Dr. Dre and Snoop Dogg:
(Never hesitate to put a nigga on his back) Yeah nigga

(Never hesitate to put a nigga on his back)
Rat-tat-tat-tat tat ta tat like that and I

Rat-tat-tat-tat tat ta tat like that, you know I
(Never hesitate to put a nigga on his back)
Rat-tat-tat-tat tat ta tat like that and I
(Never hesitate to put a nigga on his back)

Dr. Dre:
Creepin' and peepin' and I can get with these
The chronic, slangin' fat ki's from my block
And it don't stop, tell me where you wanna go
To the strip or take a trip bawlin' with the row
My shit off in your system attacks
Indo smoke go in your lungs, like that
You get lifted, calm, and if it's the bomb
Taken away like hell on Vietnam
California, back and on a mission
Provin' a point that my game ain't no fuckin' competition
They wishin' but run up on reality
CPT, CAL my locality
It's strange how I rearrange and change the business
By droppin' shit like this
Dope, niggas can't cope with the real
I peal, penitentiaries still, when I kill it goes

Dr. Dre and Snoop Dogg:
Rat-tat-tat-tat tat ta tat like that and I
(Never hesitate to put a nigga on his back) Yeah
Rat-tat-tat-tat tat ta tat like that, you know I
(Never hesitate to put a nigga on his back)
Rat-tat-tat-tat tat ta tat like that and I
(Never hesitate to put a nigga on his back) Hell yeah
Rat-tat-tat-tat tat ta tat like that, you know I
(Never hesitate to put a nigga on his back)

Snoop Dogg:
Straight up. Now you niggas know where my homie comin' from
So quit the chit-chat, before ya find yourself flat on your bizzack, fool
It's nine-duece, Dr Drizzay, is sittin' on tizzop
It don't stop, treatin' buster's like a punk-ass cizzop, beeotch
