Kay Gees:
Who is the man with the masterplan?

Dr. Dre:
Forty-four reasons come to mind
Why your motherfucking brothers' hard to find
He be walking on the streets and fucking with mine
Stupid punk can't fuck with a mastermind
See I never take a step on a Compton block
Or LA without the AK ready to pop
'Cause them punk motherfuckers in black and white
Ain't the only motherfuckers I gots to fight
I thinks it's better to be telling the facts than cuffed up
And jacked and fucked up
What you niggas looking at? You going
"Goddamn," 'cause it's the city
And for you to survive a nigga gotta be a gangsta
And I'm a nigga you can't remove
Took out a lot of motherfuckers for tryin' to prove
To their homies that they can hang by dealing with me
But once again in the end they D-E-A-D
I never did time on a murder yet
'Cause I relax, sit back, do a job and jet
Yo, I know you understand my flow
So here we go with Death Row, come let a motherfucker know

Dr. Dre:
D-R-E, a motherfucker who's known for carrying gats and kick raps that make snaps
Adapts to anything environment that I'm located at
If you see me on the solo move believe that I'm strapped
4-4, .tre-8 or AK-47
'Cause slowly but surely send you on a stairway to heaven
Just put my finger on the trigger and pull back
And lay a punk motherfucker flat
As he wonder what popped before he got popped
I told you I was Dre and you know it don't stop
Now I know you understand my flow
So here we go with Death Row, come let a motherfucker know

Dr. Dre:
I breaks 'em off, I breaks 'em off yeah
I breaks 'em off, I breaks 'em off yeah

I breaks 'em off but I ain't speaking about between the thighs
I'm talking about cocking a gauge in between your eyes
That'll make you drop to your knees 'cause you realize
That a gat will make any nigga civilized
Old buster-ass nigga talkin' bullshit
Don't know that I'm the wrong nigga to fuck with
Get lit or hit up by the doctor
A nigga that breaks 'em off properly
Real G so don't doubt it
I'm the one who's doing it while these other niggas talk about it
And if motherfuckers come at me wrong
I straight put my .44 Desert Eagle to his motherfucking dome
And show him why they call me the notorious one
The name's Dre Eastwood when I'm packing a gun
You don't believe me, well step up and give it a try
And if you die you's a buster 'cause real niggas don't die
But some still don't hear me though
You're too near me not to hear me, nigga yo so now you know
