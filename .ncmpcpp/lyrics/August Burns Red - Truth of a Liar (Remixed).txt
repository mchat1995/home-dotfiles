Allow what's done to preach new insight to your life
Hindsight is perfect vision
The past is easiest to see

Clear a path
Stand aside
We're carrying the torch now

Clear a path
Stand aside
We're carrying the torch now
Clear a path
Stand aside
There's no stopping us
Clear a path
Stand aside
We're carrying the torch now
Clear a path
Stand aside
There's no stopping us

You might think you're everything to everyone, to everyone
Go ahead
Partake in it
Justify it
Become engulfed in it
It will eat you alive

This is not a one way road
You're headed for the dead end
This is not a one way road
You're headed for the dead end

You might think you're everything to everyone
Well, pardon me if I intrude
You might think you're everything to everyone
You're not a perfect man in a perfect world

Look at where your ignorance has brought you
All this will be buried
Like the fall of Rome
Look at where your ignorance has brought you
You will come crashing down

The truth hurts
The truth hurts
The truth hurts
But denial's what will kill you

All that you loved, all that you treasure
Will pass with time, will pass with time
Blinded by the inability to see beyond flesh and blood

Shifting blame with a log in your eye
Insisting that a string tied to your limbs is what's to blame, what's to blame
Suck it up and bite the bullet
