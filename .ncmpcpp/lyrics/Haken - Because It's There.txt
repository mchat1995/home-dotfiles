Life is a dream
A gift we receive
To live and to love
We forge The Path

Our nightmare in birth
Our struggle for worth
In vain we carry on
Our mission to become

"Dream this life
Forge a path
Please take this gift
To live, to love"

Adapt to this world
This chance we must take
We'll sing our song
We'll play our hand

Why allow this crooked fate?
"Broken world"
Retaliate
The tunnel's light is unmoving
"Accept defeat"
Don't be afraid
It burns your eyes but you persevere
"Obscures the path"
You must adapt because it's there

Climb, find your way
Scale high, don't look back
With hope you will find
The life you seek

Judgement from birth
Criticize our worth
We struggled to uphold
Struck down, will we fold?

Climb, find your way
Scale high, don't look back
With hope you will find
The life you seek

"I wish I could be some one
Be the moon and be the sun
Ambition burned my wings ablaze
Shed a tear in these dark days
Tearing down the walls of love
Soaring through the fire above
Pride exists to be reclaimed
Roll the dice don't lose the game
Carry the weight of the world
The summit says I'll prove my worth
Let me claim what's rightfully
Yours to take and mine to keep
Stars begin to swarm around
The path of fate this tired ground
Challenge met but all the while
A mountain built on greed and guile"
