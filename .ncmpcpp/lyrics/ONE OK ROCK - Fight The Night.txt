Here comes the rain
So many scars never fade
This is the price of war
And we've paid with time

We'll fight fight till there's nothing left to say (Whatever it takes)
Fight fight till your fears they go away
The light is gone and we know once more
We'll fight fight till we see another day

Let's move along, it's late
The sun will rise once again
This field is lined with the brave
Souls in relief

We'll fight fight till there's nothing left to say (Whatever it takes)
Fight fight till your fears they go away
The light is gone and we know once more
We'll fight fight till we see another day
Another day

Whatever it takes... ho ho ho...

Here comes... the rain
So many scars never fade
This is the price of war
And we've paid with time

We'll fight fight till there's nothing left to say (Whatever it takes)
Fight fight till your fears they go away
The light is gone and we know once more
We'll fight fight till we see another day [x3]
