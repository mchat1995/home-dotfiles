Gently waking
A final skyward sigh
Please, send me safely home
It's almost time
Goodbye

Lay me down

The ocean at my window
Here I find myself again
All broken bones and eyes that wear their age
Like going home is etched on every page

Fragile Atlas
He carries that old smile
He will stay his weary arms
To just lay down a while

Lay me down
The ocean at my window
Here I find myself again
All broken bones and eyes that wear their age
Like going home is etched on every page

No!
Won't accept that's the way I go
(By my) quiet hand, sinking slow
Won't accept that's the way it ends
(Won't you) stay like stone and mend
I'll wear the words like Atlas, never said The day
I chose to stay
I wish I could have shared just a fraction of the peace that I found then
My friend

The ocean at my window
Here I find myself again
All broken bones and eyes that wear their age
Like going home is etched on every page
