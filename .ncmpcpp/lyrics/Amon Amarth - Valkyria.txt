Heal my wounds
Cleanse my blood
It's too soon for my life to be spilled
Into this mud

Cure my flesh
Rest my bones
I don't want to end my life all broken
And bodily torn

Sooth my mind
Ease my pain
Let me see the shores of my homeland
Once again

Come healing
Come strength
Valkyria grant me
A life of worthy length

Eir!
Eir!

And when it is time, please bring me
To the Allfather's gate

I solemnly swore
I gave you my word
Before I left our home
I promised that I would return

You begged me to stay
To not leave you alone
I went anyway and you cursed the day
I was born

No promise I gave I have broken
I've always been loyal and just
No words of lies I have spoken
So why did I earn your distrust

Come honour
Come trust
Valkyria grant me
The strength to keep my oaths

V치r!
V치r!

And when it is time, please bring me
To the Allfather's hall

V치r!
V치r!

Eir!
Eir!
