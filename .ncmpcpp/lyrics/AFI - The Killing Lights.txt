Five AM on the bathroom floor from the night before
Do you find me dreadful?
What a shame, such a sad disgrace, such a pretty face
But she's not regretful

Am I beautiful?
Am I usable?

It's killing time again
Put on your face and let's pretend
These killing lights won't kill us all again

Three A.M. on the city street, when the air is sweet
I've had my mouth full
But it seems that outside the screen such a pretty face
Often will look dreadful

Am I beautiful?
Am I usable?

It's killing time again
Put on your face and let's pretend
These killing lights won't kill us all again

It's killing time again
Cover your face and we'll pretend
These killing lights can't kill us all again

You see they always remember
They never forget a face

When they cut, cut, cut, cut, cut, cut, cut you up,
Cut, cut, cut, cut, they remember
Cut, cut, cut, cut, cut, cut, cut you up
Cut you up

It's killing time again
Put on your face and let's pretend
These killing lights won't kill us all again

It's killing time again
Cover your face and we'll pretend
These killing lights can't kill us all again
