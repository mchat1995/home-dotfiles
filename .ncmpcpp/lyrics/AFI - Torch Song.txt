I saw you
Angels came to light your path
I heard you keep their wings pressed under glass
Now am I so enthralled that I might die?
I saw you sweetly smile and say "do try", "do try"

(Anything)
I'd tear out my eyes for you, my dear
(Anything)
To see everything that you do

I saw you so bereft, so pale and weak
When I looked through, you and I declined to speak
I won't say

(Anything)
I'd tear out my eyes for you, my dear
(Anything)
To see everything that you do, I'd do
(Anything)
I'd tear out my soul for you, my dear, oh, my dear
(Anything)
To feel everything as you do, I'd do

Anything
Anything, oh

Leave me
Leave me to grieve that nothing's lost, nothing's lost
Leave me
But when you leave, know nothing's lost, nothing's lost

(Anything)
I'd tear out my eyes for you, my dear
(Anything)
To see everything that you do, I'd do
(Anything)
I'd tear out my soul for you, my dear, oh, my dear
(Anything)
To feel everything as you do, I do, I do
