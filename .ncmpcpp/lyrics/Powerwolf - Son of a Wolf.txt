Tonight alone you're riding
Onto the other side
Your might untold and waiting
Boy you'll be the final light
Your mother fought the demons
Your brother saw the light
And now we pray the unborn
You and I can't stay alive

Son of a wolf
When the fight is calling
Son of a wolf
And the night has come
Son of a wolf
Can you hear me calling
Haleluja

Take you another liar
Then never do this sign
When you are undertaken
Boy you see the night ally

Forever to the brave men
When times were hard and wild
You are the new messiah
Born a wolf of human kind

Son of a wolf
When the fight is calling
Son of a wolf
And the night is dark
Son of a wolf
Can you hear me calling
Haleluja

Son of a wolf
Can you see him dying
Son of a wolf
When the night is dark
Son of a wolf
Can you hear them calling
Haleluja

Agnus dei in tempestis
Ignarus et animus
Sanctus Iesu in tormentis
Romulus in misera
Agnus dei in tempestis
Ignarus et animus
Sanctus Iesu in tormentis
Romulus in misera

Son of a wolf
When the fight is calling
Son of a wolf
When the night is dark
Son of a wolf
Can you hear me calling
Haleluja

Son of a wolf
Can you see him dying
Son of a wolf
When the night is dark
Son of a wolf
Can you hear them calling
Haleluja
