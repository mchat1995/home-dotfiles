I see beady greedy eyes crawling out of your mouth
Fucking snakes you filthy bitch
I see the way that you are
You live to judge and feed off one another
Sheltering ideals of your own envy you could smother
Nothing but fear
So one thing is clear
We won't be the victims of their crucifixion

GTS
Shut the fuck up
GTS
Back the fuck up
GTS
Sweet dreams suckers
Time to go to sleep

You justified to crucify
But retribution never solved your demise
Eye for an eye
Blood for blood
Your controversy takes me out of my mind

Riot

Sewed mouth
Tied up
Bound and beheaded
Crucified
Genocide
Glorified by pride
Nothing but fear
So one thing is clear
We won't be the victims of their crucifixion

GTS
Shut the fuck up
GTS
Back the fuck up
GTS
Go to fucking sleep

I got one last thing to tell you motherfuckers
You think you can hunt me down?
Well you're dealing with the devil
So do what you want
Say what you will
Out of the mouth comes evil?
Go fuck yourself
Dig
Six feet under make you
Dig
Go dig your fucking grave
