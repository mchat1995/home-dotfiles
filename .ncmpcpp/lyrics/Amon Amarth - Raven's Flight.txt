As the first light touched the waves
And the ravens cawed across the bay
A mighty fleet with red white sails
Three hundred Viking ships were
On their way

War!

With thirst for blood and all-out war
A thirst that's aching through our hearts and bones
We're heading west to distant shores
To avenge our father and to win the throne

They think their God will save their skin
But all resistance will be in vain
We stare at death with crimson grins
With Odin's help we cannot fail

We hold our heads up to the sky
And know that we will never die
As long as we stand side by side
As long as we can see the ravens fly!
Ravens fly! Ravens fly!

War!

Heading to Northumbraland
Come what may we won't back down
When horns of war begin to sound
Aella's head will lose its crown

Come what may, we hold our heads
Up to the sky
And know that we will never die
As long as Odin's on our side

We hold our heads up to the sky
And know that we will never die
As long as we stand side by side
As long as we can see the ravens fly!
Ravens fly! Ravens fly!

We hold our heads up to the sky
And know that we will never die
As long as we stand side by side
As long as we can see the ravens fly!

We hold our heads up to the sky
And know that we will never die
As long as we stand side by side
As long as we can see the ravens fly!
Ravens fly! See the ravens fly!
