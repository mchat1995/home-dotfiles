The time has come to an end
Yeah - this is what nature planned

Being tracked by a starving beast
Looking for its daily feast
A predator on the verge of death
Close to its last breath
Getting close to its last breath

Rules of nature

And they run when the sun comes up
With their lives on the line
(Alive)
For a while
(No choice)
Gotta follow the laws of the wild
(Alive)
With their lives on the line
(No choice)
Out here only the strong survive

What's done is done
Survived to see another day
The game of life
The hunter and the agile prey
No guarantee
Which of them will succeed
Strong or weak

(Yell)
