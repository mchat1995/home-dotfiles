Into the white
The scent of fire behind
First steps to freedom are lighter than we ever knew

Called through the cold
We hold our daughters close
And sing to our sons
Change will surely come

Into the white
Broken faith leaves scars behind
We embrace them
Carry broken shackles by our side

Called through the cold
We hold our daughters close
And sing to our sons
Change will surely come

We left our prayers with our old gods
White hand, release
Leaves in the fading smoke
So easy to forget the voice that never spoke

Walking our own road
Each step, each breath
We are fighting for our lives
And we are losing every one
The things we gave up for a dream we are still waiting for
And still we hold on

In time

Into the white
The road is mine, and I am his
Our last steps as free men
Proud at the end. It comes to this.

Called through the cold
Road to a home we'll never know
We gave to our sons a heavy burdened hope

We left our prayers with our old gods
Hold on
Till dawn
Lost like our steps in snow
So easy to forget the way
The road we make, we own

Walking our own road
Each step, each breath
We are fighting for our lives
And we are losing every one
The things we gave up for a dream we are still waiting for

We were so young then
Firelight holds their peace
Sing farewell by smoke in the cold
We farewell the old
As they fall to silence
