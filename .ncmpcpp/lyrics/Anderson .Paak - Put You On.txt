You cold, you cold, you the coldest
I just wanna know who put you on it
How much do you teach her?
Knowledge is the motherfucking key
New move, got a lot of 'em
Remember when you only knew how to ride on it
Now you be tossing it like Serena
And I'mma run it back like a re-run

Who put you on, who put you on to that?
You didn't know about nothing
Now you know all about nothing
I put you on to that
Now look at you
Who put you on to that?
You didn't know about nothing
Now you know all about nothing
I put you on to that

You know, you know, you my favourite
I be steady drinking with you baby
Long strokes to the promise
Remember you couldn't take it at all
New moves, got a lot of 'em
Tell me when the hell you got so long winded
Talking and walking just like a diva
Now you gon' hit the news like Aretha

Who put you on, who put you on to that?
You didn't know about nothing
Now you know all about nothing
I put you on to that
Now look at you
Who put you on to that?
You didn't know about nothing
Now you know all about nothing
I put you on to that

Who put you on
Who put you on to that
You didn't know about nothing
Now you know all about nothing
I put you on to that
Now look at you
Who put you on to that
You didn't know about nothing
Now you know all about nothing
I put you on to that
