What we finally found wasn't what we wanted
Wish I could have gone to where we started

Back to black I can't see what's around me
Back to black hope to gain some control

I gave up everything

I tried to have it all
And I'm stuck in the middle
I couldn't have it all now I'm alone
And I've been down and out
Now I'm stuck in the middle
I'll never get to say this is enough

Now I'm left with nothing
Now I'm left with nothing
Now I'm left with nothing
Now

手に入れたモノで壊して虚しくなって
手放してみたらみたでまた欲しくなって
の繰り返しでハマって抜けられなくて気づくと
時すでに遅し　切られた切符に振り出しの文字

I tried to have it all
And I'm stuck in the middle
I couldn't have it all now I'm alone
And I've been down and out
Now I'm stuck in the middle
I'll never get to say this is enough

Now I'm left with nothing now

Now I'm left with nothing

I gave up everything

I tried to have it all
And I'm stuck in the middle
I couldn't have it all now I'm alone
And I've been down and out
Now I'm stuck in the middle
I'll never get to say this is enough

Now I'm left with nothing
Now I'm left with nothing
Now I'm left with nothing
Now

Now I'm left with nothing
