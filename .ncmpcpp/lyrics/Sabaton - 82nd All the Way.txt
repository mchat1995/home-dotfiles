In the draft of 1917, a man from Tennessee
Overseas to the trenches he went, from the land of the free
Into war he brought two things along, a rifle and his faith
Joined the ranks as a private, assigned to 338th

There on that day, Alvin York
Entered the fray
Saving the day
82nd all the way

Into the fires of Hell, the Argonne, a hero to be
Entered the war from over the sea
Intervene, 1918, all the way from Tennessee
Hill 223

When his faith has been put to the test, the call to arms he heeds
On the 8th of October he went, made a sergeant for his deeds
Fearless, leading the raid of the war, machine gun on the hill
Charge the enemy taking the prisoners, by power of his will

There on that day, Sergeant York
Entered the fray
Saving the day
82nd all the way

Into the fires of Hell, the Argonne, a hero to be
Entered the war from over the sea
Intervene, 1918, all the way from Tennessee
Hill 223

What Sergeant York achieved that day
Would echo to the U.S.A.
It's 82nd all the way
Death from above, what they now say

What Sergeant York achieved that day
Echoes from France to the U.S.A.
It's 82nd all the way
Death from above, what they now say

Into the fires of Hell, the Argonne, a hero to be
Entered the war from over the sea
Intervene, 1918, all the way from Tennessee
Hill 223...

Hell, the Argonne, a hero to be
Entered the war from over the sea
