From nothing soul
Nothing core
Nothing place
From nothing word
Nothing light
Nothing xx
I'm crushing wall
Crushing vice
Crushing crime
I'm crushing madness
Crushing jade
Crushing fate
So never lie
Never lost
Never end
So never does
And I'm flying through the space
Never fall
Never stop
Never down
Never burst
I'm flying just like w.i.n.d.
I'm waiting for a breakup
Where is my sight?
I kick this realize
I can get feeling now
Cry no more
I want live
I want breathe
I want feel your heart
Where is my mind?
Life is empty
I try to find out
To your side
I want live
I want breathe
I want feel your heart
No more lie down
No more kill
I stand not crawling
Not falling down
No more pain
No more decrease
I'll just be living my own life...
I'm waiting for a breakup
Where is my sight?
I kick this realize
I can get feeling now
Cry no more
I want live
I want breathe
I want feel your heart
Where is my mind?
Life is empty
I try to find out
To your side
I want live
I want breathe
I want feel your heart
