You've become their broken dreams
Innocence's a dying breed
Liberate your drowning souls
Make way to the brand new world

Evil does what it loves everywhere it goes
The good protect the rights no one will know
Amen, amen
Sin was where humanity was called for

Break us, break us, chains confine us
Save us, save us here from this world
Take us, take us, we sacrifice our own true will

So rise and pray, the end has become
Your doors to break away from demons inside us all

We'll live and reign forevermore
Forevermore

Your perfect nature's godless rapture, fault and fracture
What you want, want you want you'll never capture
Long and forgotten, these rules made for nothing
Nothing will save you and you will save nothing

Break us, break us, chains confine us
Save us, save us here from this world
Take us, take us, we sacrifice our own true will

So rise and pray, the end has become
Your doors to break away from demons inside us all
So rise and pray, the end has become
Your doors to break away from demons inside us all

Everybody's got their problems
So we'll have pity for the broken
No salvation for the faithless
Prepare the altar, sacrifice everything you got

Everybody's got their problems
So we'll have pity for the broken
No salvation for the faithless
Prepare the altar, sacrifice everything you got

Everything you got

Thy will be done in hell, for it is yours (It is yours)
Almighty Lord, who lives and reigns forevermore
Thy will be done in hell, for it is yours (It is yours)
We praise His holy name as servants of the Lord

You've become their broken dreams
Innocence's a dying breed
Liberate your drowning souls
Make way to the brand new world

You've become their broken dreams
Innocence's a dying breed
Liberate your drowning souls
Make way to the brand new world

So rise and pray, the end has become
Your doors to break away from demons inside us all
So rise and pray, the end has become
Your doors to break away from demons inside us all
