I don't know how to touch you in the voiceless, senseless, blind world.
The whole place is a black and white landscape
I live the same world as you do in the eternal time
I wish for the end of time
I wish for the end...
I'll sing for you...
Love me...
Save me...
Hold me...
I don't leave your side
Lead me...
Bring me...
Take me...
Close to your heart
The same sky, earth, air
I feel them as still
I'm apt to be controlled by loneliness
I try to break a wall
There isn't what me must not break
It is created thing all what we can see
Love me...
Save me...
Hold me...
I don't leave your side
Lead me...
Bring me...
Lead me...
Bring me...
Take me...
Close to your heart
I wish for the end of time
Fallen Love
