Day on day and night is gentle kind
We are not what we have left behind
We stumble upward led by the blind
I know, I know

Still she carries on that perfect dance
The world grows brighter here in my hands
In her bright color I understand
She moves, she moves

Guilty man been searching for a cause
This empty room is filled with applause
Better or worse, I'm not what I was
I know, I know

On your feet now
Wake up, wake up
And soon you'll see that
All hope is not lost
It's yours

Oh, you have what you need in you
Just let it grow
You have what you need
It's yours
Let it grow
Wake up, wake up
Believe, all hope is not lost
Not lost
