Sisters, moment and all
Ageless, fair
Lover, life is the fall
All for her...
The youngest will never forget
Floating by the edge
How fragile we are
Just watching petals fall

This delicate blossom is strong
Stronger than she knows
We're watching petals fall

Daughter of the mountain
Gently rises
Now mother to us all
"This is my choice, father!" she said...

She is the reason why we fall so soft
And never regret when we fought and we lost
Like petals that fall don't blame the ground
She is the reason why we fall so soft
The beauty we found
This is the cost, and life is the fall
Don't blame the ground

Waves to wind in waiting
Tender skin to skin linger
Little soul...

Daughter of the mountain
Just one day in bloom
Mother to us all

She is the reason why we fall so soft
And never regret when we fought and we lost
Like petals that fall don't blame the ground
She is the reason why we fall so soft
The beauty we found
This is the cost and life is the fall
Don't blame the ground

With love by her side
Found her voice
Brave now
Secrets confide
Make your choice...
She stays in the place in between
Pure and fleeting

We gave up our stone to love a moment gone
To float here where water meets soul
Love was given choice
There was only ever one

She is the reason why we fall so soft
And never regret when we fought and we lost
Like petals that fall don't blame the ground
She is the reason why we fall so soft
The beauty we found
This is the cost, and life is the fall
Don't blame the ground
