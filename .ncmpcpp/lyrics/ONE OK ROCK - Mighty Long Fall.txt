When we met the pain stood still
It was us
Then suddenly it's where'd you go?
The system blew I knew

The side of me I want a little more
But inside it seems I'm just a little boy
Nothing else

Don't go it's a mighty long fall
When you thought love was the top
Oh no, it's a wake up call
When your life went into shock
It seems like gravity keeps pulling us back down
Don't go it's a mighty long fall
When you know time is up

Uso wo hitotsu ai wo futatsu
Sore de nantoka yarisugoshite kita desho
Demo sore ja mou boku wo damasenai desho
Ja dousuru? Doushiyo?

Don't go! It's a mighty long fall
When you thought love was the top
Oh no, it's a wake up call
When your life went into shock
Egakitagari na mirai ni asu wa nai
Isso douse itamu nara itame tsudzukeyou
Tsudzukeyou

Get up, get up, get up, get up
Time to make amends for what you did
Get up, get up, get up, get up
Running with the demons in your head
Let's shout it out completely
You never really wanna know
Let's shout it out, we're screaming

Don't go it's a mighty long fall
When you thought love was the top
Oh no, it's a wake up call
When your life went into shock
It seems like gravity keeps pulling us back down
Don't go it's a mighty long fall
When you know time is up

Don't go don't go don't go don't go
