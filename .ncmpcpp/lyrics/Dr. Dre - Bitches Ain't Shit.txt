Snoop Dogg:
Bitches ain't shit but hoes and tricks

Bitches ain't shit but hoes and tricks
Lick on these nuts and suck the dick
Gets the fuck out after you're done
And I hops in my ride to make a quick run

Bitches ain't shit but hoes and tricks
Lick on these nuts and suck the dick
Gets the fuck out after you're done
And I hops in my ride to make a quick run

Dr. Dre:
I used to know a bitch named Eric Wright
We used to roll around and fuck the hoes at night
Tighter than a motherfucker with the gangsta beats
And we was balling on the motherfucking Compton streets
Peep, the shit got deep and it was on
Number one song after number one song
Long as my motherfucking pockets was fat
I didn't give a fuck where the bitch was at
But she was hanging with a white bitch doing the shit she do
Sucking on his dick just to get a buck or two
And the few ends she got didn't mean nothing
Now she's suing 'cause the shit she be doing ain't shit
Bitch can't hang with the streets, she found herself short
So now she's taking me to court
It's real conversation for your ass
So recognize, and pass to Daz

Daz Dilinger and Snoop Dogg:
Now as I'm rolling with my nigga Dre and Eastwood
Fucking hoes, clocking dough up to no good
We flip-flop and serve hoes like flapjacks
(But we don't love them hoes) Bitch and it's like that
This is what you look for in a hoe who got cash flow
You run up in them hoes and grab the cash and get your dash on
While you're chilling with your homies and shit
And how my niggas kick the anthem like this (Beeotch)

Snoop Dogg:
Bitches ain't shit but hoes and tricks
Lick on these nuts and suck the dick
Gets the fuck out after you're done
And I hops in my ride to make a quick run

Kurupt and Snoop Dogg:
To the store to get me a 4-0
Snoop Doggy Dogg paged that must mean more hoes
So I head down the street to Long Beach just so I could meet a freak
To lick me from my head to my feet
And I'm here, now I'm ready to be done up
Nothing but homies around so I puts my gun up
Bitches on my nuts like clothes, heh
But I'm from the Pound and we don't love them hoes
How could you trust a hoe? (Why?) 'cause a hoe's a trick
We don't love them tricks (Why?) 'cause a trick's a bitch
And my dick's constantly in her mouth
And turning them trick-ass hoes the fuck out now

Snoop Dogg:
I once had a bitch named Mandy May
Used to be all in them guts like every day
The pussy was the bomb, had a nigga on sprung
I was in love like a motherfucker licking the pearl tongue
The homies used to tell me that she wasn't no good
But I'm the maniac in black, Mr. Snoop Eastwood
So I figure niggas wouldn't trip with mine
Guess what? Got gaffled by one time
I'm back to the motherfucking county jail
Six months on my chest, now it's time to bail
I gets released on a hot sunny day
My nigga D.O.C. and my homey Dr. Dre
Scooped in a coupe, "Snoop we got news
Your girl was tricking while you was draped in your county blues"
I ain't been out a second
And already gotta do some motherfucking chin-checkin'
Move up the block as we groove down the block
See my girl's house, "Dre, pass the Glock"
Kick in the do', I look on the flo'
It's my little cousin Daz and he's fucking my hoe, yo (Bitches ain't shit)
I uncock my shit
I'm heart-broke but I'm still loc'ed, man, fuck a bitch

Bitches ain't shit but hoes and tricks
Lick on these nuts and suck the dick
Gets the fuck out after you're done
And I hops in my ride to make a quick run

Bitches ain't shit but hoes and tricks
Lick on these nuts and suck the dick
Gets the fuck out after you're done
And I hops in my ride to make a quick run

Jewell and Snoop Dogg:
(Bitches ain't shit)
Oh yeah
I don't give a fuck about a bitch (Bitches ain't shit)
But I and her know that they can't fade this
'Cause I'm doin' my own thang down with the swang (Bitches ain't shit)
I'm hanging with Death Row like it ain't no thang
I say you know you can't deal 'cause I'm a bitch that's real (Bitches ain't shit)
Motherfuckers need to step back, hell yeah they need to chill
Because I don't give a fuck and I don't give a fuck (Bitches ain't shit)
And I don't give a fuck, I don't give a fuck

And now I gotta do some shit that's clean (Bitches ain't shit)
But when I'm on a dick, hell yeah, I get real mean, hah
Like a washing machine, I can wash the clothes
All the hoes knows that I'm on the flo', hoe
But they can't hang with my type on swang (Bitches ain't shit)
I ain't trying to say I suck every ding-a-lang
But just the juicy ones with the tip of the tongue
And then they're sprung and with the nuts hung (Bitches ain't shit)
