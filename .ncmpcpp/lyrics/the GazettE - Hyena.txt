Ugly acting and song
踊りが下手なHandsome
Your copulation is dirtier than money
Unprincipled strategist
乱用middle aged spread
ブラウン管の隅で天狗気分さ

Please disappear because it is an eyesore

You were born from the mouth?
節穴に続ける媚びしかない
Your copulation is dirtier than money
Unprincipled strategist
乱用middle aged spread
半狂乱な餓鬼はびしょ濡れさ

Please disappear because it is an eyesore
It fails together if going straight

Curtain of wine red  識別出来ぬ
流されるまま  踊る夢
左右に倣う  歪  Masquerade

飾れば靡く愛に
溺れる今の君に
群がるのはー瞬の供鳴
温室崩れのPrince
後頭部にシャンデリア
廃れたその日  共鳴はHyena

君の顔に咲いた声は
理想重ね飼い殺すよ
安易な「永久」は使い回しの夢

何色の涙で
何色の言葉で
塗り潰せばその顔でいられる?
見え過ぎた痕跡
与え過ぎた嘘に
自惚れたまま朽ちてくよ  ほら

English Translation

Ugly acting and song
You're just a can't-dance Handsome
Your copulation is dirtier than money
Unprincipled strategist
Abuse, middle aged spread
Feeling like a braggart at the nook of a BROWN pipe

Please disappear because it is an eyesore

You were born from the mouth?
Nothing but continuing flattery from your knothole
Your copulation is dirtier than money
Unprincipled strategist
Abuse, middle aged spread
The half-crazed brat is drenched to the bone

Please disappear because it is an eyesore
It fails together if going straight

Curtain of wine red  cannot tell apart
As it flows down  A dancing dream
Imitating left and right  Crooked  Masquerade

In a decorated swaying love
Drowning in this moment
Those who swarm to you are instant sympathizers
A ruined greenhouse Prince
A CHANDELIER in the back of your head
Those dying-out days  Your sympathy is a Hyena

The voice that bloomed in your face
Is a worthless pile of idealism
Facile “Eternity” is an overused dream

With mulitcoloured tears
With mulitcoloured words
If painted over, could you exist with that face?
The imprint seen over and over
In the lies given over and over
You're rotting as you're self absorbed  See?
