The hole we filled with the world we built
And you know damn well it won't save us
So hold it till the world stands still
But you know damn well it won't save us

We nailed it shut
A world to rot
And we beg from the bones of the soil to scream back
"No, you can't save us!"
"It won't be us!"
It repeats it again like you breathe old rust
Be the weight to the rope
Be the wolf to the lamb
But it won't do a good goddamn
You can't save us

The road lay long
We were too far gone
Did we burnt that bridge?
Am I just sleeping?
Still breathing...
Carry gold to dust
It repeats it again like you breathe old rust
Be the change, be the hope
Be the mind to the man
Be the world to the flame
But it won't do a good goddamn this waiting

I will face it with my arms open
I feel these eyes on me
Drink in this sweet
Surrender (comfort me)
I feed this desperate hunger
I swallow all I'd hoped for
So fuck your prayer for rain
Pray for rust

It won't save us

I feel these hands on me
Welcome this weight
Surrender (comfort me)
I am your rope
Your burden
The windowless room
The water
So fuck your prayer for rain
Pray for rust

Dam this waiting

I will face it with my arms open
I feel these eyes on me
Drink in this sweet
Surrender (comfort me)
I feed this desperate hunger
I swallow all I'd hoped for
So fuck your prayer for rain
I feel these hands on me
Welcome this weight
Surrender (comfort me)
I am your rope
Your burden
The windowless room
The water
So fuck your prayer for rain
Pray for rust
