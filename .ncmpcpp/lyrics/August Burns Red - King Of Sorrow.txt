I'm the angel of the dead
Take a good look at me (Take a good look at me)
Grief is my guilty pleasure
I'm taking comfort in your pain

My happiness is your defeat
Your heartache makes me feel so complete
The compliments roll in and remind me I'm a good friend
I'm here for you until the end

Open the door, let me in
I need you, you need me too
Open the door, let me in
Let me in

I am the king, king of sorrow
I am the king, king of sorrow
Bow to me now, give me your tears
I am the king, king of sorrow

Rest assured that everything will be okay
It's all going according to plan
Let me speak for you in these times of dread
I'll be your guide, now please just rest your head

I am the dead ringer
If it bleeds then it leads
Misery loves company and you've just met your match

Open the door, I'll leave you be
Thank you for your sympathy
Open the door, I'll leave you be
I am the saint of empathy

Farewell (Farewell)
Farewell (Farewell)
Farewell (Farewell)
Farewell (Farewell), I've consumed all that I need
Farewell (Farewell), I am the saint of empathy
