Forever you will rest in peace

You can't stop me

You think you're god and you control me like a paper doll
I've seen my friends flatter you to be your assholes
Bitch
I will never beg a favor of you
And this is for the people stuck in this dying womb

Make way for me
Take the blame for it
Pay the price for it
You deserve it
[x2]

You crossed the line
So sick of bias-minded fools
Should I break the fourth like deadpool?
You fuckin' parasite
You fuckin' cancer
Say what you want,
Then i'll spit in your ugly face

You'll soon know what it is like to burn in hell

You fuckin' parasite
You fuckin' cancer

I know what you said behind my back,
But you can't give me even a tiny crack
I'll never be a part of you

Rise up now
You never hold us down
Our time is running out
Destruction - reconstruction
The world needs re-creation

You can't stop us now

Make way for me
Take the blame for it
Pay the price for it
You deserve it
[x2]
Rise up now
You never hold me down
My time is running out
You can't stop us

Rise up now
You never hold us down
Our time is running out
Destruction - reconstruction
This world needs re-creation
