Talkin' to this cutie on FaceTime
Tryna figure out if she gon' give me that face time
I don't wanna tour, I wanna chill with my son more
Teach him about Egypt and tranquility
Critically analyze Black Lives and respectability
While Prodigy' mural get vandalized, why Prodigy?
The project politics obviously, demagogue democracy
In the fog I see the Mobb representer enter the light
Back to the source where all energy comes
Your enemy Dunn was eternal, a disease that needs a vaccination
Plagues black seeds, and the industry ain't as friendly as it first seems
When you dream of driving your whip to your house on Florida Keys
On behalf of me and Queens and all of the G's, Bandana P will always stand as tall as the trees

First things first, this should be understood, QueensBridge just ain't any other hood
His music legacy is incredibly high pedigree
I don't mean this disrespectfully, alphabetically, if it's hard to swallow
In the credits of BeatStreet singin' is Bernard Fowler
He sang with the Rolling Stones, background for Bootsy Collins
Marley Marl, advanced rap sounds, perfect timing
The early eighties, we babies, Pebblee Poo dropped
The beat was crazy and Marley was changing Hip-Hop
Then Marley and Shante caught a body, UTFO
She cold, 'Roxanne's Revenge,' she was fourteen years old
Then came the Juice Crew and the who's whos
G-Rap, Rakim and Kane, beats made in the Q-U
I was probably playin' with .32's in the lobby
It's QueensBridge over everything and everybody

I wish the book never came out and everything got straightened out
Before you left, I saw you, it was all love except
We needed to build more and get things correct
Now I gotta accept it, 'cause there's honor in death
Wish you was here with us P

Shout to Havoc, shout to 'Pone, shout to Jungle, shout to Jeff, shout out to big Lord
The big dog, Lord! Free Bar (Bar) Spunk (Spunk) It's a lot going on
Free the kings
A lot going on, man, it's heavy
GoodFellas, man, Prodigy, man, it's heavy, man
We need to lighten it up, to all y'all
My bros
