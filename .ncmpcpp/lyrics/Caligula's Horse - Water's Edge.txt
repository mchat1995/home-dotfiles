Cool water
Lay yourself down
Deep, silent
Let yourself drown

Bathe in the light as morning brings us home
Light gives way to gravity
Centre me (Water's edge)
Look for me (Water's edge)
Released

Cool water
Lay yourself down
Deep, silent
Let yourself drown

To the fray you pay no mind
But the blood we share dispels disguise
You're weak and human, just as lost as I
Try and stand against the tide
Your grip on all they know begins to slide
Repeat the words "I'm fine."

Just know they're blameless in all of this
But still content to walk on broken glass beside him
To just let go
To walk away unscathed while others stay to take the fall

Choice it fades; compassion guides
Through the flames of selfless suffering you stride
The weight will pull you down in time
In their vacant, open eyes
You find no empathy behind their smiles
Without control, survive

Just know they're blameless in all of this
But still content to walk on broken glass beside him
To just let go
To walk away unscathed while others stay to take the fall

We spit truth like fire

Break your bonds and hear me:
I have heard your words, and I am unchanged
Walls of wood and stone fall
But we are of words

We spit truth like fire
