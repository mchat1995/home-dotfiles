You've given up on us
You've taken all I've made and all I've become
You've given up on us
Just another empty promise by those I love

Pushing me down flat on the ground
Trying to escape the pain
I needed you to meet me half way
But I'm left abandoned with nothing more to say
I thought family was forever
I thought family stuck together
What's done is done, I'm too far gone
I've never felt so alone

Accept what you've done and rise to the challenge
(Rise to the challenge)
Stop pointing the blame, there's no on left to betray
You're full of broken promises

These days are dark, filled with heavy clouds pouring on me
I'll keep giving while you keep taking
As my trust in you is breaking
I see now my sacrifice got left by the wayside
You've given up on us
You've taken all I've made and all I've become
You've given up on us
Just another empty promise by those I love

Put your arms in the air
Just another empty promise by those I love
Prove your worth, and part the sky for me
