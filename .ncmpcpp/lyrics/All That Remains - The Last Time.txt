Now close this chapter move on, just one last time and I'm gone
Keep telling myself that it's under control and that's a lie I damn well know

I'll return to the scene of the crime
And I'll gather my pride
Still I know you'll be long gone

Gnaws and turns as the fear builds inside
Seems much stronger than I
Still I know you're gone

I can remember
The day that you told me
I won't be there, I'm not that strong

Holding these memories
I fear I'm folding
This is the last time
Now I'm gone

Now close this chapter move on, just one last time and I'm gone
I'm holding my breath, keep praying it's over
Still I fear what's coming

I'll return to the scene of the crime
Seems much stronger than I
Still I know

I can remember
The day that you told me
I won't be there, I'm not that strong

Holding these memories
I fear I'm folding
This is the last time
Now I'm gone

Now I can see the light of day from here
I guess you helped make me strong
And when I think of what you put me through
I guess it's better that we moved on

And I'll close this chapter, move on
Soon I'll be long gone
And I walk away, and I walk away from, from you

I can remember
The day that you told me
I won't be there, I'm not that strong

Holding these memories
I fear I'm folding
This is the last time
Now I'm gone
