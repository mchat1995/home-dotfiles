Do you remember when you and I were young
We always stared each other down 'til we were numb
There in the madness, us against the world
And every heartbeat felt like this is what we deserve

With every heartbeat
With every heartbeat
With every heartbeat
With every heartbeat
With every heartbeat
We were dancing to the sound of a broken heart

I remember running in the dark
We were dancing to the sound of a broken heart
There in the madness, us against the world
And every heartbeat felt like this is what we deserve

We were dancing to the sound of a broken heart
We were dancing to the sound of a broken heart
With every heartbeat
With every heartbeat
With every heartbeat
With every heartbeat
With every heartbeat
We were dancing to the sound of a broken heart
We were dancing to the sound of a broken heart
We were dancing to the sound of a broken heart
We were dancing to the sound of a broken heart
We were dancing to the sound of a broken heart
