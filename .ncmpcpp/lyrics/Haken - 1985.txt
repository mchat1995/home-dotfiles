I stand map in hand
Direction misaligned
I play my role
With the cast of a die
It spins through the air
Bound by gravity
So why can't I
Feel momentum pulling me?

Their design
Shifting frame by frame
Blur the lines
The cycle starts again

My first step
Was undertaken aimlessly
Yet I arrive
As if I meant to be

Conceived by desire
Or compelled by certainty?
Did I decide
Or did the road choose me?

Their design
Shifting frame by frame
Blur the lines
The cycle starts again

All I am
Blood, flesh and bone
Hand in hand
Love, trust and hope
Step by step
All roads lead home
Birth to death
Thy will be done

Break the code
Find your soul
Cast the die
Lose control

Break the code
Find the formula
Lose control
In euphoria

Their design
Shifting frame by frame
Blur the lines
The cycle starts again
