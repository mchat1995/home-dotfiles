With half conscius
Solitude call again
Usual morning that light doesn't come

You wanna die
In the world wrapped in madness
Life is cut off against the will
Do you face the condition?

Death is freedom
It's dream of vacancy
Death has just extinguish you from the world
You will drop out in remembrance

You that don't have confidence in yourself
Think you are needless and such is you

Till your dying day, there's any likelihood
Have the courage to change your self

Till your dying day, there's any likelihood
Have the courage to change your self

With half conscius
Solitude call again
Usual morning that light doesn't come

You wanna die
In the world wrapped in madness
Life is cut off against the will
Do you face the condition?

You that don't have confidence in yourself
Think you are needless and such is you
