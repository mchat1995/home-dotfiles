I burn for you every time I hear your name
When I think I see your face, I know, it must be madness
I feel the sting striking at me like a match
Anything to bring you back, if only for a moment

I can feel your slow burn growing in me
Everywhere I go, you're right there with me, holding on, ever long
Wish I could forget I could not remember, all I have left is the ash and embers
Permanent, smoldering

Just like a slow burn, stay with me forever
I can't let you ever fade away
Just like a slow burn, say you'll never let me down and never go out

I fall apart like paper put to flame
The life we had reduce to ashes right before us
Every hurtful word, burned into my side
Much to hard to speak, scarred to deep to hide

Just like a slow burn, stay with me forever
I can't let you ever fade away
Just like a slow burn, say you'll never let me down
And never go out, my slow burn, burning me down

I walk the fire, I feed the flame
I'd walk the fire, I'd feel your flame

Just like a slow burn, stay with me forever
I can't let you ever fade away
Just like a slow burn, lay with me forever
Our light it shines forever, never fades away

Just like a slow burn, stay with me forever
I can't let you ever fade away
Just like a slow burn, say you'll never let me down
Please never go out, my slow burn, burning me down
