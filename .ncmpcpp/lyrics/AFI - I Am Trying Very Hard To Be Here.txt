Before you came what was your name?
Did you look like me?
No one's from here, no one my dear, not even the trees
So change your name, just keep your face
We're temporary anyway
Before you came we played this game in our masquerade

(Flash, flash, car crash) we're no fixtures
(Quick, now, quick) take our picture
(Flash, flash, car crash) we're no fixtures
(Whoa) whoa

What was your past?
When was the last time that you recall
Someone you knew was someone who
Asked nothing of you?
So lose your past, I'm sure you'll find
It's in the way all the time
Before you're through
You're someone who looks a lot like you

(Flash, flash, car crash) we're no fixtures
(Quick, now, quick) take our picture
(Flash, flash, car crash) we're no fixtures
(Whoa) whoa

We can't, can't remember the seasons
We chant in the manmade snow
We can't, can't recall the feelings
We cannot show, oh

(Whoa)

(Flash, flash, car crash) we're no fixtures
(Quick, now, quick) take our picture
(Flash, flash, car crash) we're no fixtures
(Whoa) whoa

(Flash, flash, car crash) we're no fixtures
Take our picture
(Flash, flash, car crash) we're no fixtures
(Whoa) whoa

(Hey)
(Hey)
