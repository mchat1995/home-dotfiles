If you'd tell me it's real
I can make an appeal
To the controlling fragile child
Let me speak. He won't make sense
Until we reach the consequence
It's voluntary like your smile
As he quakes

Now I know
This must be love
Now I know
Now I know
This, this must be love
Now I know
This must be love

This must be love
Oh

When you dared me to feel
When I made that appeal
To the incorrigible child
You stuffed his mouth with dirty rags
And tied his head within a bag
Pitch black and silken like your smile
He's silent...

Now I know
This must be love
Now I know (oh)
Now I know
This, this must be love
Now I know

Little drops upon my cuffs
(Little drops upon my cuffs)
Let me know this must be love
Red, red, drops upon my cuffs
(Red, red, drops upon my cuffs)
Let me know this must be love
Now I know this must be...
This must be love

Now I know
This must be love
Now I know (oh)
Now I know
This, this must be love
Now I know
This must be love

Little drops upon my cuffs
(Little drops upon my cuffs)
This must be love
Let me know this must be love
This must be love
Red, red, drops upon my cuffs
(Red, red, drops upon my cuffs)
This must be love
Let me know this must be love
Now I know this must be...
This must be love
