A brave new world rising

I, I can't believe my eyes
We've fallen down
We're blinded by dark skies

It's in the way we all exploit the weak
The justice that we seek
Accept the truth to be free

Times have changed
Don't let fate remain the same
Life, so fleeting
Ah!

The future's ours to take when we doubt everything
No, no turning back, now!
Now find, find your own path
But don't, don't give in to wrath
Ah!
