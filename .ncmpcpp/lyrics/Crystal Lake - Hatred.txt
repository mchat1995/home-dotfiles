You wanted hatred?
No complications
If you wanted war
Well I am war that you've been aching
You have awaken the son of satan
Money power fame and still you'll show the world you're fake shit

Learn to shut your mouth before you piss somebody off again
Drop the beat (but) won't drop the beat
So face defeat
I won't drop this beat cause

You got what you need from life of deceiving ones that believe that what you achieved is justice?
Trust me
It's disgusting
Suckling off of contributions
Too late to save yourself
Construct to destruct as your soul is forsaken
I ain't no snitch
I just do what I please
Karma's a bitch, going down on her knees
Pray for your health
Pray for your soul
God will not answer
I'll be at your door

What is my name, bitch?

You wanted hatred?
No complications
If you wanted war
Well I am war that you've been aching
You have awaken the son of satan
Money power fame and still you'll show the world you're fake shit

You wanted pay back?
Then we'll do it in style
I got my crew up in this business
We've been here for a while
You want some proof bitch?
And we will prove it
If you're fucking special
Then come prove yourself you're worth it
For all y'all gold diggers
You gotta dream bigger
You're just a shit painted in gold when the lights dimmer
So what's my name bitch
Come say my name bitch

You wanted hatred?
No complications
If you wanted war
Well I am war that you've been aching
You have awaken the son of satan
Money power fame and still you'll show the world you're fake shit

Drop the beat (but) won't drop the beat
So face defeat
I won't drop this beat cause

Don't you know my fucking name?
You Have awaken the son of satan
You wanted war?
WelI I am fucking war

Bow down and stay down
Stay down before I lay down
Stay the fuck down

Drop the beat (but) won't drop the beat
So face defeat
I won't drop this beat cause
