Don't waste your touch
You won't feel anything
Or were you sent to save me?

I've thought too much
You won't find anything
Worthy of redeeming

Yo he estado aquí
Muchas veces antes
Y regreso

To (Break down!)
And cease all feeling
(Burn now!)
What once was breathing
(Reach out!)
And you may take my heart away

Imperfect cry
And scream in ecstasy
So what befalls the flawless?

Look what I've built
It shines so beautifully
Now watch as it destroys me

Y regreso
Aquí otra vez
Y comienzo

To (Break down!)
And cease all feeling
(Burn now!)
What once was breathing
(Reach out!)
And you may take my heart away

(Break down!)
And cease all feeling
(Burn now!)
What once was breathing
(Reach out!)
And you may take my heart away

I saw its birth
I watched it grow
I felt it change me

I took the life
I ate it slow
Now it consumes me

I (Break down!)
And cease all feeling
(Burn now!)
What once was breathing
(Reach out!)
And you may take my heart away

(Break down!)
And cease all feeling
(Burn now!)
What once was breathing
(Reach out!)
And you may take my heart away
Heart away
