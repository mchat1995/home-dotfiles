Heartbreak incarnate
I'm nothing if not your memories
Heartbreak, please let me be
Your joy and your pain

Someday I will be
I'll be those common words spoken uniquely
Because I may, will forever be
Floating as you feel

Please let me haunt as scent on your pillow
Letters of past all tear-stained and wrinkled
Please let me haunt as scent on your pillow
Letters of past all tear-stained and wrinkled

Just say, say you will follow me
Follow me, invite me to your memory
Just sing, sing again follow me
Follow me, that long forgotten song

Heartbreak incarnate
I'm nothing if not your memories
Heartbreak, please let me be
Your joy and your pain

Someday I will be
I'll be that waking warmth from a fading dream
Because I will, I may at best
Float as you feel

Please let me haunt as scent on your pillow
Letters of past look distant and wrinkled
Please let me haunt as scent on your pillow
Letters of past look distant and wrinkled

Just say, say you will follow me
Follow me, invite me to your memory
Just sing, sing again follow me
Follow me, that long forgotten song

Let me be all the words
Let me be all the words
Let me be all the words
Let me be all the words

Let me be all the words echoing comfort
Let me be all the words that you'd unsay
Let me be all the words echoing comfort, comfort, comfort, comfort
Let me be all the words that you'd unsay, unsay, unsay, unsay

Let me be all the words echoing comfort
Let me be all the words that you'd unsay
Let me be all the words echoing comfort, comfort, comfort
Let me be all the words that you'd unsay, unsay, unsay, unsay
