Now
It's time to choose
Can you hear the clock tick tick tick tack
Tick tick tack
Got no time to lose
No hesitation, or straight to the fucking noose
Tick tick tack
Just follow your instinct
There's no reason to resist

This is the apocalypse
Middle finger to opportunists
We're just making history
Are you motherfuckers ready for the new shit?

They're running running
They're running running
Running their mouth
They'll never ever never get out

I know why
I know why
I know why
I know why
I know why you wanna hate it
I know why
I know why
I know why
I know why
I know why you wanna hate it

I draw the line, so choose your side
No regret
No compromise

This is the apocalypse
Middle finger to opportunists
We're just making history
Are you motherfuckers ready for the new shit?

They're running running
They're running running
Running their mouth
They'll never ever never get out

I know why
I know why
I know why
I know why
I know why you wanna hate it
I know why
I know why
I know why
I know why
I know why you wanna hate it

I'm sitting on the side of Satan
Now let the chaos reign
Break
Oh bring the chaos to the floor
Are you motherfuckers ready for the new shit
Oh bring the chaos to the floor
Everybody bounce now
Everybody bounce now
Everybody bounce now
Everybody bounce now
You see it spinning that shit
It's freaking and raising hell
Nothing lasts forever
You better know we will kill the trend
Don't make it stumble
No time for grumble
The clock is ticking
So live it up tonight
I'm gonna give you hell and feel it
This is it
We are new chaos
This is it
Lose your fucking mind and now it's time to let it go
Don't you think
I will take you where you've never known
Pull the trigger while we're dancing with death
We're gonna bring the chaos here
You better watch your fucking neck
Lose your fucking mind and let it go
Let it go
I will take you where you've never known
Never known
Now it's time to let it go
Let it go
Bring the chaos here
You better watch your fucking neck
