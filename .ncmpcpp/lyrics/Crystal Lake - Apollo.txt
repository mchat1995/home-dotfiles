We made from nothing
So take it away again, take it away

Take it away

Taking over earth and beyond the skies
Show me a sign you down to ride?
For progression, we stay alive 'cause we need the pain
For progression

I want it all space time in sync
Life intertwines my desires in sonic speed
We lift from the ground
Blasting off much higher and higher we go

You'll never take me under
Never gonna take me under

Broken down, this burden was mine
'Cause gravity holds nothing refined
Now forever
We'll live forever

I want it all, there's more to this
I want it all, there's more to this

You'll never take me under
Never gonna take me under

Now we are falling, falling down
Falling, falling down to nowhere, to nowhere
Now we are falling, falling down
Falling, falling down to nowhere, now we are falling down

The universe ain't big enough for all of us
Open the sky
This universe was not big enough for us
Open the sky

Taste of our past left in their future
View from the sky, I'm the rainmaker
This odyssey got me lit
'Cause I'm getting fired up in commotion, it's true

See beyond what you're suppose to
Choose to see what I see, you won't dare to deny it
Who is ever gonna find me
When gravity breaks away?

Whoever knew we'd go where gravity breaks away
Now we've reached beyond where gravity fades away

You'll never take me under
Never gonna take me under
You'll never take me under
Never gonna take me under

Now we are falling, falling down
Falling, falling down to nowhere, to nowhere
Now we are falling, falling down
Falling, falling down to nowhere, now we are falling down
