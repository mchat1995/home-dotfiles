In the realm of Svartalvheim
Where master forgers reign
Loke met with Eitri and Brokk

With malice and deceit
He got them to agree
To create nine magic gifts for the Asa gods

Brokkr had a sense of foul play in the air
So he made a wager for Loke's head

Treasures will be forged
For the Asa gods
A spear and ring
For the Asgård king
But finest of them all
The Crusher it is called
Mjölner! Hammer of Thor

Loke's treachery
Knows no boundaries
He hid himself in the blacksmith's cave

But as work progressed
He feared he'd lose his bet
He knew his situation now was grave

Working the bellows
Heating the forge
Striking the anvil
Striking with force

Then as they worked on the last gift
A mighty hammer of war
Loke disrupted the work of the blacksmiths
The handle came out short

The nine gifts were brought to Odin's mighty hall
As Loke feared the gods praised them all

Treasures have been forged
For the Asa gods
For the Vana prince
A ship and boar
But finest of them all
The Crusher it is called
Mjölner! Hammer of Thor

Brokk came to claim his price
Loke fooled him twice
He saved his lying head
But got his mouth sewn shut instead

Treasures have been forged
For the Asa gods
For Sif they made new hair of gold
But finest of them all
The Crusher it is called
Mjölner! Hammer of Thor
