Watching this world return to dust
How cold is this grave...?
We are powerless in our rightful end
As we wander and wonder and ponder and...

Far, beyond the sky
Laughter echoes still

Mortal empires crumbling away
Fleeting memories
Colorless puppets return to nothing
In our minds we're forever and ever and...

Everything returns to nothing
Everything I took for granted
Now pats me on the back
Do you resent yourself...?

I can hear remorse's lonely
Steps down the hallway
There is no excuse...

A humanity that traveled to the moon
But could never really overcome itself
We never learn...

We run, closing our eyes till we fall
We dance, gardens are fading to gray
We run, was my life worthwhile at all...?
Your smile, last green field on planet earth...

As if tomorrow never comes again
In a world that we wished for
As if no voice is to be heard again
Grasping tightly on a tear...
