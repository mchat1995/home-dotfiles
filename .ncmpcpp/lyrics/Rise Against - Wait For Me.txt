Do you see the world in different colours?
Do you see the world in black and grey?
Alone in your thoughts
How many others
Have stood where you stand
Where you stand today
I've stood where you stand
But all, can you

Wait for me now
To take off this crown
To break all these vows
Don't you know?
Wait for me now
Air's running out
Wait for me (x4) now

A promise of safe return I delivered
But the ocean is wider than I first guessed
When roads disappeared
I followed the rivers
But somehow got in over my head
So a deep breath I'm taking

Wait for me now
To take off this crown
To break all these vows
Don't you know?
Wait for me now
Air's running out
Wait for me (x4) now

A lost dream of what could have been
A house on fire a tangled web
The key turns
To find the locks have changed
In time to hear the back door slam
A sound that to this day I can't forget
The colours drain to black and grey

Wait for me now
To take off this crown
To break all these vows
Don't you know?
Wait for me now
Air's running out
Wait for me (x4) now
