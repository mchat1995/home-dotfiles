Bang bang go the coffin nails
Like a breath exhaled
Then gone forever
It seems like just yesterday
How did I miss the red flags raise?
Think back to the days we laughed
We braved these bitter storms together
Brought to his knees he cried
But on his feet he died

What god would damn a heart?
What god drove us apart?
What god could...

Make it stop
Let this end
Eighteen years pushed to the ledge
It's come to this
A weightless step
On the way down singing
Whoa oh oh oh oh oh

Bang bang from the closet walls
The schoolhouse halls
The shotgun's loaded
Push me and I'll push back
I'm done asking I demand
From a nation under God
I feel it's love like a cattle prod

I'm born free but still they hate
I'm born me no I can't change
It's always darkest just before the dawn
So stay awake with me let's prove them wrong

Make it stop
Let this end
Eighteen years pushed to the ledge
It's come to this
A weightless step
On the way down singing
Whoa oh oh oh oh oh

The cold river washed him away
But how could we forget?
The gatherings hold candles
But not their tongues
And too much blood has flown from the wrists
Of the children shamed for those they chose to kiss
Who will rise to stop the blood?

We're calling for
Insisting on
A different beat
Yeah, a brand new song

Make it stop
Make this end
This life chose me, I'm not lost in sin
But proud I stand of who I am
I plan to go on living

Make it stop
Make this end
All these years, pushed to the ledge
But proud I stand of who I am
I plan to go on living
