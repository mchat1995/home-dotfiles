I can't control myself
The second hand does not stop
The end roll of movie flows
And it becomes pitch black soon

Nobody stop being
The other myself appears soon, you ask
I ask which is real myself?
(Break out this) timeless space

From here
I'll fly away from timeless space
From here
Look at sky where you live

My reflected in a mirror
Is it i?
You control me
You and I are faced

Why did you say?
Why do you see?
Why did you save?
I need your life in this my life

Why did you say?
Why do you see?
I can feel your life
Into your life

Why did you say?
Why do you see?
Why did you save?
I can feel your life into your life

Why did you say?
Why did you save?

Why did you say?
Look at sky where break out this way
