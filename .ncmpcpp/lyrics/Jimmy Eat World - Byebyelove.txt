I walked out at 3 A.M.
The coward inside me told me so
I couldn't stand to lie with you
'Cause when I do I can tell

It's bye bye love
Bye bye love
It's bye bye love
Bye bye love

I wanna feel that golden light
Watch summer dancing through your hair
There's so much I wish I could hold
Instead of carrying memories

Bye bye love
Bye bye love
It's bye bye love
Bye bye love

Bye bye love
Bye bye love
Bye bye love
Bye bye love

Bye bye love
Bye bye love
It's bye bye love
Bye bye love

Bye bye love
Bye bye love
Bye bye love
Bye bye love
