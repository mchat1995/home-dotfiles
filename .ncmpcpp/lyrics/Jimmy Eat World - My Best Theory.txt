It's been a long time, so long
There's only one life I know
But I have my own mind
I'll say so if it seems right

(Hey, rush out)

I see a warm face with the soft mouth
But it speaks something else
So I'll take my chances with the cast-down
We can feel the air

Rush out, out from the center
Not like one side is any better
Stand up as they bend, reaching
My best theory; it's already in me
(Already in me) In me (In me)

(We can feel)
(We can feel)
(We can feel)
(We can feel the air)
(Rush out)

So many questions
And the answers come back unanswered
Let's hope the old script gets a new twist
You can feel the air

Rush out, out from the center
Not like one side is any better
Stand up as they bend, reaching
My best theory; it's already in me
(Already in me)

In a lonely real place
Neither plan nor mistake
Love what you have with your time

By dowsing find my true design?
My flag? My appetite?

(My true design)

I feel the air

Rush out, out from the center
Not like one side is any better
Stand up as they bend, reaching
My best theory; it's already in me
(Already in me)

Rush out, out from the center
Not like one side is any better
Stand up as they bend, reaching
My best theory; it's already in me
(Already in me) In me (In me)
