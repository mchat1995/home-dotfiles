I am your good tool
How much do you buy us for?
Let's negotiate
Value of the pain...

Do you know?
What your removed
In the party meeting place of that day...
Those are trust and respect
Only intent to murder is left
It is laughing with the wineglass,
A splendid toast to the old men!
Let's send this song to dear swindler

Hey chairman!
Listen with those ears
Guide it to the hell

To you who think about things with money
Let's send this word
You and so on can't manipulate me!
It can't become a music machine!
Will any amount be in the substitute?

I am your good tool
How much do your buy us for?
Let's negotiate
Value of the pain... 「Can you pay it?」

Do you know?
What your removed
In the party meeting place of that day...
Those are trust and respect
Kneel before me
Dear chairman!

Even if the tail is wagged for the hit chart
You can't become a hit maker. 「Give up right now!」

To you who think about things with money
The last contract
You and so on can't manipulate me!
This is the way that mine does it
Sign this contract
「Don't show that dirty face again!」
