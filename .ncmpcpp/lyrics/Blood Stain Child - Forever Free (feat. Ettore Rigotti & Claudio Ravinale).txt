So far away
No one else knows my place
Feel my dream
Feel my boundless mind

I lost many memories
I need not be restricted
Wake up now
Wake up the time is right

Where is merry place
Stained with blood

Forever free... Yeah
Forever floating in light
My gray, lucid dreams yeah
Forever

I am floating in endless space
No more cry and fate
Feel my dream
Feel my eternal voice
So far away
Beyond the cyber future
Wake up now
Wake up now

Forever free... Yeah
Forever a lonely flight
My bleak, silent screams yeah
Forever free... Yeah

Were gonna breal down the timeless space

This night time before the delight
Wake up
Take my hand
Feel my dream
Feel my eternal voice

Fly away in silence
Dive into the deep infinity
Wake up now
Wake up now

Forever free... Yeah
Forever a lonely flight
My bleak, silent screams yeah
Forever free... Yeah
