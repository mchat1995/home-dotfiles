(Music: Einar Solberg and Baard Kolstad, lyrics: Tor Oddmund Suhrke)

Your road is paved
Yet coloured in black
Concealed by the night
It remains

Undiscovered
Until the dawn
Hidden from the light
It remains

When night confines you
Take my torch

Illuminate
Your god might not rise
Light your way
Illuminate
No ray meets your eyes
Find your day

Moulded by the tide
Where your shelter lies
Covering your path
Invisible

The fire slowly died
Couldn't stop your cries
Hidden by your wrath
Invisible
Invisible

Illuminate
Your god might not rise
Light your way
Illuminate
No ray meets your eyes
Find your day

Waiting for someone
Daring to see
Shades on your pathway
Leading to me
