Is it mentally abusing or abusing your mentality?
I'm just stuck between the finer things of life of trying to find what to eat
So what if there was glory?
And there's bitches when I'm horny

Only if I'm smiling 'cause I'm wilding out
And I'm stunting casually like fashion week on Ginza streets
Is it acting if you don't believe in what you are stunting?
It's confusing, did you want me or not want me?

If I want you then you don't want me
Then you want me when I don't want you
Not amusing, just confusing
For my choosing but I want to

If I want you then you don't want me
Then you want me when I don't want you
Not amusing, just confusing
For my choosing but I want to

Before a time it wasn't much too long ago
Before a time when I was not aware of you
Before a time it wasn't much too long ago
Before a time when I was not aware of you
