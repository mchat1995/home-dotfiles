You said to me so. "Please love until dying..."
For what do you hope to me? Is it the hopeless last scene?
Answer..., I don't want to die.
DA DON VIDIVI DA DON AGAIN DA DON VIDIVI DA DON
The scream of insomnia. Is the next my turn?
What is a lethal weapon?

Oh shit! It was done too much.
Oh shit! Oh, pardon me...
Oh shit! It was done too much.
Oh shit! Don't come near me.

Did you really love me heartily? Can you really call that love?
Answer... I don't want to die.
DA DON VIDIVI DA DON AGAIN DA DON VIDIVI DA DON
The scream of insomnia. Is the next my turn?

Lethal weapon is lip. Your affection rape me.

Let's sing to you again.
This is the last copulation.
Why can't you understand it?
Can't you hear my shout?
Again... until hate goes away.
Don't touch me! Don't touch heart! Don't show that face!
I don't want to die.
