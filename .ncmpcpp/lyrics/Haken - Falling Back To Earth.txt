Save me now
Set me free

"If you could only show me how"

Show me how
To live my dream

"Living the dream I will die"

Aiming high
Shooting low

"You won't be laughing when I'm"

To raise the bar
Or take the fall?

"Climbing the mountain"

Someone rescue me
Help me, please!
Against all odds
I long to be free

Will no one listen to my plea?
The sky is falling in on me

"Save me now, set me free, show me how, live a dream
Aiming high, shooting low, raise the bar, take the fall
Rescue me, help me please, how long to be free
Intervene, I'll defeat, all those who stepped on me"

Intervene
I'll defeat
All the people who
Stepped on me

You have been standing in my way
You won't believe it when I'm

Soaring through the sky
Free from your burden
Say your last goodbyes
I won't be back again

(Solo)

When my name becomes tomorrow's news
On top of the mountain I cannot be moved
I scale the summit like an unstoppable force
With iron wings I will prove my worth to you all

I will be dancing on your grave
You won't be laughing when I'm

Soaring through the sky
Free from your burden
Say your last goodbyes
I won't be back again

Too close to the flame
Ambition has burned me
With my wings ablaze
I'm falling back to earth

(Part II: Fall)

Now that my feathers are broken
Crestfallen my head is bowed
Splashing down into the ocean
Something seems different now

The world I once knew has eroded
Humanity's fossilised
The beasts have become the new masters
Is reality compromised?

Advanced technological breakthroughs
And superior firepower
The frontiers of war and resistance
Seem abstract and vacant now

For countless years I have been longing
To apologise, apologise
A world without end is upon us
But time is in short supply

Soaring through the sky
Free from your burden
Say your last goodbyes
I won't be back again

Too close to the flame
Ambition has burned me
With my wings ablaze
I'm falling back to earth
