Greed ignites your sin
Black seed burns in a bed of lies
Destroy and annihilate our world
Tearing grace from purity to survive

Helpless life doused in a flash
Plunge in the knife, burning to ashes
They plead, they don't know why they're on show
Hell holds a place for all of us

Watching my friends bleed
I break down, I concede
In life, I knew paradise and freedom
With those now unknown to me I will fly

Helpless life doused in a flash
Plunge in the knife, burning to ashes
They plead, they don't know why they're on show
Mercy betrayed, floods cannot wash away

All of the pain rushes in
Beauty deceased, instinct takes over
Bygone are the days, darkness reigns
Hell holds a place for all of us

Life, endless paradise
Beauty painted by sin
Hell on Earth breeding ignorance
The door opens for us

Greed ignites pain inflames the weak but we remain bygone
Marching on, they watch as their kind suffer and die before them
Is this not some kind of genocide? Breaking, crushing, defiling
We live as Lords of the Earth, we bear powers of mercy yet we choose

Life, endless paradise
Beauty broken by sin
Hell on Earth breeding ignorance
The door opens for us

Life, endless paradise
Beauty destroyed by sin
Hell on Earth breeding ignorance
Hell holds a place for us

Open the door
Open the door
