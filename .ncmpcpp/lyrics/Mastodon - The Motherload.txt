I can see what the world has done to you
I can feel the weight
Feel the weight
I can see what this life has handed you
I can feel the weight
Feel the weight

This time, this time
Things'll work out just fine
We won't let you slip away
This time, this time
Things'll work out just fine
We won't let you leave this way

If you want it, you can will it
You can have it
I can put it right there in your hands

I can hear what the spirits are telling you
I can clear the weight
Clear the weight
I can see all the wolves as they circle you
I can crush the weight
Crush the weight

This time, this time
Things'll work out just fine
We won't let you slip away
This time, this time
Things'll work out just fine
We won't let you leave this way

If you want it, you can will it
You can have it
I can put it right there in your hands

This time, this time
Things'll work out just fine
We won't let slip away
This time, this time
Things'll work out just fine
We won't let you leave this way

If you want you want it, you can will it
You can have it
I can put it right there in your hands
