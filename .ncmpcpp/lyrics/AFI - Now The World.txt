Summer, I painted
A scene
That lit the stars for me
Said, "I can erase it
For you, dear"
That summer created
Those words
That came to life in three
They were denied by you

Summer, I laid down
Below the glitter-adorned night
And silently sparkled
My own way
Summer, I laid down
By you, and shared my frail light
You gave the dark to me
(You gave the dark to me)

I looked inside (I)
To find (wanted)
The one I sent away (this excoriation)
I nearly froze
When I stepped inside (I)
To find (thrive on)
The flowers turned to gray (this self-mutilation)
I closed my eyes
And kissed them one last time
Oh

Summer, a morning
So pale
Alone when they found me
As I remained sleeping
I heard them say
"This summer created
A boy
Of abject misery"
He was designed by you
(He was designed by you)

I looked inside (I)
To find (wanted)
The one I sent away (this excoriation)
I nearly froze
When I stepped inside (I)
To find (thrive on)
The flowers turned to gray (this self-mutilation)
I closed my eyes
And kissed them

So like a lost child
I will hide (Now the world)
And like a lost lie
I will find (Now the world)
Find a way to return to the ones who made me
Cover your eyes and we'll die together

Will you cry for me?
Will you cry for me?
Or will you die with me?
Or will you cry for me?
Or will you cry for me?
Or will you die with me?
Will you cry for me?
(I've been a lonely one)
Will you cry for me?
(I've had this whole world)
Or will you die with me? (Drained from me)
Will you cry for me? (Am I the only one?)
Will you cry for me?
(I've had this world)
Or will you die with me? (Drained from me)
Drained from me

Summer, I painted
A scene
That lit the stars for me
Said "I can erase it
For you, dear"
