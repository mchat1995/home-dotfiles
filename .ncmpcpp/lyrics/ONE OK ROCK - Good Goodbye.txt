You're the light, I'm the shadow on the wall when you sleep
Everything that I need is right here with me

Come to me
All that I can say's already said
I come to you
There is one word that I can't forget

Goodbye
Good goodbye
Goodbye
Good goodbye

Little time, not a moment wasted with you
I realized to stay
We had to break away

Come to me
All that I can say's already said
I come to you
There is one word that I can't forget

Goodbye
Good goodbye
Goodbye
Good goodbye

Little time, not a moment wasted with you
