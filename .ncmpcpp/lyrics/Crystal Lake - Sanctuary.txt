Innocence, it was gone a long time ago
Ambivalence, I have been fighting against
I'm tired and lost and there is no one to trust
Inside my heart, it's digging deep (Digging deep)

I can't find the way out of this misery
One foot in hell now you can't deliver me
Don't wake me up, wake me up from my sleep
Won't fade away, fade away this agony

The crown of thorns

I just want to break free
I bite my tongue until it's numb
I'm waiting for the night to come
I hold the knife with my knuckles white to protect my sanctuary

I opened the sky and it swallowed me whole
I walk alone but I'm not afraid no more

But all my innocence, it was gone a long time ago
Ambivalence, I have been fighting against
I'm tired and lost and there is no one to trust
Inside my heart, it's digging deep (Digging deep)

I can't find the way out of this misery
One foot in hell now you can't deliver me
Don't wake me up, wake me up from my sleep
I'm a slave to agony

This crown of thorns wound like a snake
Forever it'll give me a peace of mind
This crown of thorns wound like a snake
Forever it'll give me a peace of mind

This crown of thorns wound like a snake
Forever it'll give me a peace of mind
This crown of thorns wound like a snake
Forever it'll give me a peace of mind

This crown of thorns wound like a snake
Forever it'll give me a peace of mind
This crown of thorns wound like a snake
Forever it'll give me a peace of mind
