As I drift away into sandman's embrace
My soul stretches out like a caged bird
That yearns to fly...

Trapped in a nightmare, harrowing reverie
All darkness crumbles
As I reach out my hand to you

Far away, breaking the distance
What kind of miracle are you waitin' for?
Falling... Please embrace me
- A raging whisper inside -

As my spirit floats in the vast, dreamy space
There's a light closin' in
Makes my eyes fill with stars

Showered in light an eerie sound calling me
Echoes through my veins
As my voice calls out to you

I've never met such a destiny
What kind of miracle are you waitin' for?
Behind this a horizon of sound
- A raging whisper inside -

And in sunlit fields where the flowers grow tall
And your sound fills the air makes the earth feel so small
Synchronizing minds distant heartbeats align
In the sky, conscience awakes and we're closer than ever before

Long live life
Cross my heart
And those words you feed to the light
I wonder if I can touch you
Wanna feel you right now

One, what is the passion of music?
Two, what is message of voice?
Three, what is power of sound?
Four, these are all in my life

And I'm in front of this universe
We're just empty lovers vows

And in sunlit fields where the flowers grow tall
And your sound fills the air makes the earth feel so small
Synchronizing minds distant heartbeats align
In the sky, conscience awakes and we're closer than ever before...
