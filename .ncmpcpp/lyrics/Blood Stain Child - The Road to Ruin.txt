In the apparently peacful world
Towns are crowded with people and cars everywhere
No one notice and see that safety always doesn't assure

Murders are everyday occurrence
Now they go on...
Crimes and disputes never die out

The world that perfect peace is not
Turns the desire of people into chaos

We and wars live side by side
We don't know when to die
The reliance of the world in nuclear warhead
It's symbol of military strength
Humans beings voluntarly choose the road to ruin
