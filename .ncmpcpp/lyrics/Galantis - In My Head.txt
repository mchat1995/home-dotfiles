Gasp for days but it's out of my hands
When I wake up home, I'm ditching my prayers
When I close my eyes, I can lust at your face
I'm gonna fall fall hard, no I don't give a damn

I wanna love out loud but I'm scared to say
It's like a ton of bricks that will fade away
I do it for you
I do it for you

Now you're in my head and it's out of my hands
When you're in my thoughts I don't wanna pretend
And the lies I told you
But you're in my head, but you're in my head
Do it for
Do it for

Think I won't feel a thing if I give it some time
But your love is a wave washing over my mind
And I stare my world, now we can't hide
Laying next to you, my heart is on fire

Now you're in my head and it's out of my hands
When you're in my thoughts I don't wanna pretend
And the lies I told you
But you're in my head, but you're in my head
Do it for
Do it for you, you, you, you, yeah
Do it for you, you, you, you, yeah
Do it for you, you, you, you, yeah
