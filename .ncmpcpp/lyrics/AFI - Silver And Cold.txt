I, I came here by day,
But I left here in darkness
And found you, found you on the way.

But now, it is silver and silent.
It is silver and cold.
You in somber resplendence,
I hold...

Your sins into me,
Oh, my beautiful one.
Your sins into me.
As a rapturous voice escapes
I will tremble a prayer
And I'll beg for forgiveness.
Your sins into me,
Your sins into me
Oh, my beautiful one.

Light, like the flutter of wings,
Feel your hollow voice rushing
Into me as you're longing to sing.
So I, I will paint you in silver.
I will wrap you in cold.
I will lift up your voice as I sink.

Your sins into me,
Oh, my beautiful one, now
Your sins into me.
As a rapturous voice escapes
I will tremble a prayer
And I'll beg for forgiveness.
Your sins into me,
Your sins into me

Cold in life's throes.
I'll fall asleep for you.
Cold in life's throes.
I only ask you turn away.
Cold in life's throes.
I'll fall asleep for you.
Cold in life's throes
I only ask you turn
As you seep into me,
Oh, my beautiful one, now...

Your sins into me,
Oh, my beautiful one.
Your sins into me.
As a rapturous voice escapes
I will tremble a prayer
And I'll beg for forgiveness.
Your sins into me,
Your sins into me

Your sins into me,
Oh, my beautiful one, now
Your sins into me.
As a rapturous voice escapes
I will tremble a prayer
And I'll beg for forgiveness.
Your sins into me,
Your sins into...
Your sins into me
Your sins into me,
Oh my beautiful one!
