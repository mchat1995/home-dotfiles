Five carloads deep, time to go do a show
Got a massive crew and we're ready to roll, so
I grab my gear hop in the whip and ride
Premier he's got the fly dope system inside
But my shit cranks too and we've got mad tapes
Of all the underground groups with the lyrics and bass
Off into the New York night we go
Dre Large got the camera, Biggest Gord's got three rolls of film
So we can take the macked out photos
Tommy Hill, the Damaja, and my man Gusmo
Corey and Smurf, and Lil Dap's got a forty
My man Gary and Shiz and the Nutcracker shorty
Mike Rone, chillin' like Capone
Robinhood, known as Mel with the clientele
Mo, J.T. Mega, and can't forget Black
Big Rob and Sincere, yes, the posse's fat
Outloud pulls up, plus there's Sid and O.C.
Big Mel from Strong Island, H.L. the one and only
O'Delicious, Eli, 'Bazz, and Eon
And the aroma of the blunts has me thinking beyond
And to the rest of the crew you know the bond is strong
And you know who's who, so let me not prolong
For this was a night to remember
I had on the beige Tims with the two-tone leather
So we get to the jam, the gig, the venue
Then we circled around and then drove in through
The front - the place was packed, the line was long
I was bobbing my head 'cause the music was on
I turned it down, then I peeped to my right
I saw this kid and his girl having a fight
Another kid walked up and mushed the kid in his face
And then the kid pulled out and bust him and laid him to waste
A riot broke out, girls screaming and scheming crews
Started buck wiling tryna' snatch kids' jewels
After that, 5-0 came and turned the party out
And then the ambulance came to take the body out
And we didn't even get all the equipment out
And we didn't even get to turn the place out
This can happen often and it's really fucked up
So I'll ask you to your face, homeboy, what's up?
Did you come to see my show or to the stupid nigga playoffs?
Killing you and killing me, it's the soliloquy of chaos

And if you live in cities where the streets reek warfare
People getting nowhere but you go for yours there
You'll find it doesn't pay to front or play the role
You could get stole or maybe beat with a pole
Then you'll wanna retaliate, regroup, and come back
So you set the brothers up for a sneak attack
Whether you die or kill them, it's another brother dead
But I know you'll never get that through your head
'Cause we're mislead and misfed facts, we're way off
Killing you and killing me, it's the soliloquy of chaos
