I am the hunter, I am the great unknown
Only my love can conquer
I am the, I am the hunter
I am the hunter, into the wild we go
Give up your heart, surrender
'Cause I am the, I am the hunter

We've been on this road to a place that one day, we'll know
Adventure to the other side
Searching high and low for the treasure deep in your soul
The fortune teller's always right

Got the red eyes in the night
Like a panther, outta sight
Gonna sing my battle cry
'Cause I am the, I am the, I am the

I am the hunter, I am the great unknown
Only my love can conquer
I am the, I am the hunter
I am the hunter, into the wild we go
Give up your heart, surrender
'Cause I am the, I am the hunter

I am the
I am the, I am the
I am the
I am the, I am the, I am the, I am the

Strangers wild and free
Through the flames, you're all that I see
A force you, that you can't deny
Heed my calling
Lock and load, come running to me
Dancing through the midnight

Got the red eyes in the night
Like a panther, outta sight
Gonna sing my battle cry
'Cause I am the, I am the, I am the

I am the hunter, I am the great unknown
Only my love can conquer
I am the, I am the hunter
I am the hunter, into the wild we go
Give up your heart, surrender
'Cause I am the, I am the hunter

I am the
I am the, I am the
I am the

I am the, I am the, I am the
I am the, I am the, I am the hunt
I am the, I am the, I am the
I am the, I am the, I am the hunt
I am-I am, I am-I am, I am-I am
Hunter
