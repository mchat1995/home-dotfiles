I wanted to take you
From those robes to feel the cold
Undressing the blessings
Feels like my afterlife, my afterlife

I go on
Yet on that night I went down with the lights, somehow
Over and over I go on
They carried me out when the lights went out
Over, I'm over

I wanted to keep you
But I was told you'd grown too old
For someone who stayed young by bleeding light
My afterlife... is black and cold

I go on
Yet on that night I went down with the lights somehow
Over and over I go on
They carried me out when the lights went out
Over, I'm over

I go on
Yet on that night I went down with the lights somehow
Over and over I go on
They carried me out when the lights went out
Over, I'm over
