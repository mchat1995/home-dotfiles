Born the son of a legend
What will be my fate
Will his shadow always loom above
Or will my name prevail

The weight I carry from his past
Has always weighed me down
I've struggled hard to find my path
To prove I am my own

Ironside
That's my name
It will live in infamy
Ironside
Sing my name
For all eternity

I have travelled on the wind
It's brought me far and wide
Through rain of blood and storms of steel
My legacy is mine

Ironside
That's my name
It will live in infamy
Ironside
Sing my name
For all eternity

(Järnsida Järnsida)
(Järnsida Järnsida)

And never has my blood been shed
In countless wars and fights
This kenning is my true name
They call me Ironside

Now here I sit on Svitjod's throne
The land that's now my home
And when my soul to Asgård's flown
Here I'll rest my bones

Ironside
That's my name
It will live in infamy
Ironside
Sing my name
For all eternity

Ironside
That's my name
It will live in infamy
Ironside
Sing my name
For all eternity

I'm Ironside, Svitjod's King
I am Svitjod's King
