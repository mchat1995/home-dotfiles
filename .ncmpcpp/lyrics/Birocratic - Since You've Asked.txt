Dream on, dream on
Dream on, dream on, make a wish

Dream on, dream on
Dream on, dream on, make a wish

Dream on, dream on
Dream on, dream on, make a wish

Little boy, little girl
You defining this pearl
Put your hand in a curl
You could touch the world, I said

[verse]

Dreams
Sitting right here in your pocket
They clouding your passion with profit
Then lock it up deep in a closet
And it’s okay if you a novice

Just surround yourself with folks
Who hold you close, and really don’t take no nonsense
I heard that you grew up in the projects
Had a dream you could taste like chocolate

But your friends they drop like faucet
And you seeing the coffins too often
So you’re stuck in the world that you’re lost in
You withdraw this soul that you deposit

And I know that your rolling with caution
And I know that your homies were coughing
…...and they want you to cough too
But know their dream was lost too

I know it seems it’s all cool
But know this road is your rule
So hold this poem as your pool
That you could jump in when you need to

And when you underwater you could dream too
Make sure you don't fall asleep
Plan it out and pick your team

Then execute it by all... means

Dream on, dream on

Little boy, little girl
You defining this pearl
Put your hand in a curl
You could touch the world, I said

[verse 2]
And if you in the back of the room
With a dream so strong
Put your hands up high

If you front of the room
With a passion that’s booming
Then I’m your guy

What did you do after yawnin?
Did you eat breakfast this morning?
Did you make a list that you’re scoring?
Did you learn something that’s foreign?

I know I hold my thoughts in my books
That only me, myself could look inside
And though I thought the lonely ride was shaky
Time forsake me

Everybody say dreams!
Everybody say goals!
Everybody say passion!
We improving everything lacking

I’m feeling wonder...
Everybody say full

I’m on a rope to my dreams
That only I pull

And only I grow (whoa)

And only I know (though)

Dreams...
