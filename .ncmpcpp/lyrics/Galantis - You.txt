Hey, what's your name?
Hey, what's your name?
'Cause I need to know
'Cause I need to know

I've been high and I've been low
Far beyond and far below
Never seen you before
If I die before I wake
Promise me you'll remember me tomorrow

'Cause I'll remember you
I'll remember you
I'll remember you
I'll remember you
You
You
