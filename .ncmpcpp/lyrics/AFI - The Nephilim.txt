Swing through sadness, tears of joy
Curse the sunlight, arsenic for the girls and boys
Drink the madness, smoke so coy
Smile injection

Serum of a will destroyed, serum of a will
Serum of a will destroyed

The seasons change, change without me
I remain in shadows growing wings
The spirit song still surrounds me
In refrain, in shadows growing wings

Swing through sadness, tears of joy
Curse the sunlight, arsenic for the girls and boys
Drink the madness, smoke so coy
Smile injection

Serum of a will destroyed, serum of a will
Serum of a will destroyed

The seasons change, change without me
I remain in shadows growing wings
The spirit song still surrounds me
In refrain, in shadows growing wings

Like an angel with two broken wings
Reach the to sky again
Like a devil meant for better things
I will find my place on high

The seasons change, change without me
I remain in shadows growing wings
The spirit song still surrounds me
In refrain, in shadows growing wings
