Walked away, heard them say
Poison hearts will never change
Walked away again

Turned away in disgrace
Felt the chill upon my face
Cooling from within

It's hard to notice gleaming from the sky
When you're staring at the cracks
It's hard to notice what is passing by
With eyes lowered

You walked away, heard them say
Poison hearts will never change
Walk away again

All the cracks they lead right to me
And all the cracks will crawl right through me
All the cracks, they lead right to me
And all the cracks will crawl right through me

And I fell apart

As I walked away, heard them say
Poison hearts will never change
Walked away again

Turned away in disgrace
Felt the chill upon my face
Cooling from within
