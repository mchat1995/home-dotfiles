O Purple flame!
O whirling wheel ov life!
Appear! Move! Rise!

Come unto me Bartzabel
By the laws divine I quell
Come unto me Bartzabel
By the raging blood cells
Come unto me Bartzabel
By the spear, the sword, the spell
Come unto me Bartzabel
By the word that openeth Hell!

By Ra Hoor Khuit!
By Elohim!
By Samael!
By Seraphim!
By Hoor and Khem!
By Gods ov War!
Ares and Mars, and mighty Thor!

Come unto me Bartzabel
By the power ov the panther's spell
Come unto me Bartzabel
By the circling citadel
Come unto me Bartzabel
By this mind ov miracles
Come unto me Bartzabel
By the moon and stars, I swear!

By Ra Hoor Khuit!
By Elohim!
By Samael!
By Seraphim!
By Hoor and Khem!
By Gods ov War!
Ares and Mars, and mighty Thor!

By Gods ov War!
By Khem and Hoor!
By Hachiman!
Mentu, and all
And by thy master, Graphiel
Come unto me
O Bartzabel!
