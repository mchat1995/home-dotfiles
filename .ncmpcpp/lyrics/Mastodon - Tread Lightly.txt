Through the ages
All the weary and the blind
Facing the unknown

Off the venom, center our lives
Knowing not your own is unwise
And I will return for more
The light will lead you ashore

Paralyzed by, paralyzed by
Paralyzed by thorn, inside

To the angel
Breathing on me from the right
A guilt you'll never know

From the devil
Staring from the left-hand side
Souls to animal

Recede your eyes, sulk in disgust
When there is doubt, look to the obvious
And I'll decide what you will pay
Changing your mind seals our fate

Paralyzed by, paralyzed by
Paralyzed by thorn, inside

Open your eyes
Take a deep breath and return to life
Wake up and fight
Fight for the love and the burning light

Open your eyes
Take a deep breath and return to life
Wake up and fight
Fight for the love and the burning light
