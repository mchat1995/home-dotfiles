Wild kites, darling we hold on
We grip with white knuckles, we hold strong

And they say love should fit like gloves, perfect equals
If it's meant to be then you just know it, you just know
But you and me will never be the perfect people
Of all the stories that they've told

Ooh, what if our love is written in the scars?
It took time, but we built love from all these broken parts
And that's just fine, we'll be fine, just stay true

We can't fix all our fractured bones
And that's just it, it's better off we don't, love

And they say love should fit like gloves, perfect equals
If it's meant to be then you just know it, you just know
But you and me will never be the perfect people
Of all the stories that they've wrote

Ooh, what if our love is written in the scars?
Ooh, we built love from all these broken parts
And that's just fine, that's just fine

Stay true
Me and you
Stay true
