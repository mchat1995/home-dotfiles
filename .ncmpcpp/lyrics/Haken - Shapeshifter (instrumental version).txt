Dance into the masquerade
I am the only man who has a face
In this land of no identity
Who leads your secret society?

So deep in her disguise
I fail to recognize
My sister, the shapeshifter
Will never change her ways

You make the first descent
This atmosphere becomes intense
As you start to undress
My robes of consciousness

So deep in her disguise
I did not recognize
My sister, the shapeshifter
Will never change her ways

In the mist you fade to grey
Lost in a city where vampires are guarding the gates
And you vanish with no trace
Warped and distorted
My fear is escorted away

Pleasure I mistake for pain
My demons and angels are playing a dangerous game
Inside the vessel of my friends
I'm haunted by strangers
They're craving a thirst for revenge

I surrender to the view
To find the replacement
A manifestation of you
One God to whom I seldom pray
Created the science
You work in mysterious ways

So deep in her disguise
I still don't recognise
My sister, the shapeshifter
Will never change her ways

When you are dreaming
I am wide awake
Believe when you see me
In the mind's eye I wait
While you are sleeping
