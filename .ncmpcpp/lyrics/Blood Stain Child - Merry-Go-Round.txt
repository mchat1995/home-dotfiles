I am flying I am diving
I am flying I am diving

I feel the winds of life
Will the sun rise will it shine on me?
In void I'm in this spiral fate
I can't escape from here
Stargazing at twilight time
Will an angel fall in my dream?
Invite let it be my remembrance
Let it be many days
Will I wake up in a hopeful new world
Or a soundless void? Endless fright...

How many long winters passed
Craving for light in snows embrace...
Dance with me all the thing in this world
Dance with me
How long will the travel take?
Will the snow cover my traces?
Weird fate is it not gonna change?
I'll beat this fate this time
Will I wake up in a starry new world?
When I vanish... What lies beyond this all?

I am flying I am diving
In this endless sky disintegrating
I am flying I am diving
Where am I going in this lifeless wave?

Live, it's the freedom to be yourself
I'm traveling on percentage
Die, it's the freedom from yourself
The glory waits for me
Live with my mind
I don't know what fear awaits
With my mind the sky surely exists
I will beat this fate this time

Pale light is piercing through the snow...

I am flying I am diving
A silent planet rising in my travels
I am flying I am diving
As long as I can fight I will keep fighting

Live, it's the freedom to be yourself
I'm traveling on percentage
Die, it's the freedom from yourself
I will beat this fate this time
