Sometimes war is killing, sometimes it's saving lives
It's the judgement of fate, it's nothing that man can dictate
Corporal Leslie Allen carried them from Tambu
Saved his brothers in arms, sent out and followed through

There and back again, Bull just carried on
Under fire he carried them out one by one
There and back again, bullets all around
All of the men that he carried away
Twelve men would now live to see one more day
His fear held at bay, as he carried them away

Sometimes war is killing, aometimes it's saving lives
From Australia's shore, Bull Allen went to war
Sometimes war is saving, sometimes it's taking lives
Thanks to one single man, a dozen more survive

Some men return from a war in a bag, and yet the world knows their story
Others return unwilling to brag, alive and humble at heart

No...
