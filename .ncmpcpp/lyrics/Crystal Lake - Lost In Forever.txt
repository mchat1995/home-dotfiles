Birth of emotion and death through the flood
I've never felt alive seeking death through your blood
You smell, taste, touch the same but how's it feel to go through change?
Holding me for this misery to escape it all

What makes them memories?
Is the way we chose to stay
To save our everything
Then it seems like I just don't belong

You know we drew these lines while trapped inside
Are we who you say we've become?
Somehow we draw these lines while trapped inside
Will we realize what we've become?

Are these our memories?
Never thought we would fall for nothing, no
Always thought we could stand for something
But you failed to express this one thing
That you and I are still meant for everything

You know we drew these lines while trapped inside
Are we who you say we've become?
Somehow we draw these lines while trapped inside
Will we realize?

We're lost in the moment that we've called forever

Break free, I'm settled like the reservoir
Every comfort feels the same without you anymore
Crucified my own desire
But you want what you can't just like I want the same

If I finish what I started, what will I have to lose?
You're the scar in my heart, living proof of my youth
When will I ever again or never again
Will our heartbeat synchronize again?

Can you hear me?
Are you near me?
The closer I get
The further away you go

We're lost in the moment that we've called forever

You know we drew these lines while trapped inside
Are we who you say we've become?
Somehow we draw these lines while trapped inside
Will we realize?

We're lost in the moment that we've called forever
We're lost in the moment that we've called forever
We're lost in the moment that we've called forever (That we've called forever)
We're lost in the moment that we've called forever
