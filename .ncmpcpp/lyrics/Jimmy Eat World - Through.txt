Sounds so great, everything you're saying
Do lies out loud change anything?
Go get mad, have a child's tantrum
Till everyone knows how wrong you've been

Look around, that's not me
Not one shred of who I'll be
You don't know what I'd do
The one way getting out is through

Damn there's no practical advantage
To chase that love from people hurting you
See all kinds one who think they need it
The ones who take it, then ones who know the truth

Look around, that's not me
Not one shred of who I'll be
You don't know know what I'd do
The one way getting out is through

Slow things down, baby check your motives
You sleep at night and stand up straight
Keep in mind there's a big, big difference
To letting go and running away

Look around that's not me
Not one shred of who I'll be
You don't know know what I'd do
The one way getting out is through
