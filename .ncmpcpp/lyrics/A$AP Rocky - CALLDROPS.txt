Eyedrops, ("Fuckin' with the killas")
Teardrops
Droptops, ("Fuckin' with the killas")
Ice blocks (Beat drop, I drop)

I was thinking to myself (Calldrops)
Maybe I should seek some help
Maybe I should blame myself
My mistake in stealth is going away
("Don't expect no money")
It's going away, it's going away

Eye drops
Teardrops
Droptops
Ice blocks

You used to be so soft
This is a prepaid collect call from
("Fuckin' with the killas")
You were for (teardrops)
An inmate at Florida Correctional Institution
This call is subject to recording and monitoring
(Uh-huh, yeah, I'm ready, got you on speaker)

All the pain I went through (went through)
Turned to a singer
I put it all on my tattoos (tattoos)
'Cause of where I came from
If I ain't ever learned before (learned before)
(This call is subject to recording and monitoring)
Then this will be painful
Sleeping in institutions, I lost my baby
If that ain't ever woke me up, then it's gone wake me (woke me up)
But I'm keeping a light up on my fire, then they took my baby
I man on kind, is doing his time, but it's for no reason
I mean the kind, that ride the pipe, something you free-something you free-something you free
