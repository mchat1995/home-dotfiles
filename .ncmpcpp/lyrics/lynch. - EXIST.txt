If I could stop the world tonight
I would freeze this moment in time
Oh if I only could
Our bodies dance like the wind over and over again
In a perfect sky
Hypnotized by the sound
I get lost and then found
In your eyes

'Cause it doesn't get better than this
No it doesn't get better than this
Oh if we could stop the world tonight
I think that we should try
'Cause it doesn't get better than this
Oh, better

If we could have one night on repeat this is it
Over and over we dance to the beat to exist
We're gonna live while we're young
So let's wait for the sun
Before we go home
Lock it all in our minds
Memorize it tonight
'Cause we all know

That it doesn't get better than this
No it doesn't get better than this
Oh if we could stop the world tonight
I think that we should try
'Cause it doesn't get better than this
Oh, better

Ha!

Oh if we could stop the world tonight
I think that we should try

'Cause it doesn't get better than this
No it doesn't get better than this
Oh if we could stop the world tonight
I think that we should try
'Cause it doesn't get better than this
Oh, better
