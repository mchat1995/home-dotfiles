Watch me, my measures get desperate
Stand beside me, keep your head calm

Futile pride holds back my endeavour
Talking loud, beneath my own palm

Will you follow me if I ask you?
Will you wait for me if I stop?
Will the time I give you be helpful?
Shall our lives be one till I drop?

Will you wait if I stop?
Will you wait if I drop?
Will you wait if I stop?
Will you wait if I drop?

Repent, relearn, do it all again
No need to know your lie
Repent, relearn, do it all again
No need to know your lie

Bring back the blissful words
They still make no sense
Copy, paste, at rest I'm in suspense

Will you follow me if I ask you?
Will you wait for me if I stop?
Will the time I give you be helpful?
Shall our lives be one till I drop?

Surrender to a forgettable story
Narrow idea of a doubtful start
Inverted fury surpasses me
Settling in my heart

In seems to me that you know by now
All the right ways this should be done
Obstacles vanish miraculously
Contaminate me, contaminate me
Contaminate me, now run, run
