If London Bridge is falling, let's hurry up in crowds
Justify the meaning, before the feeling's lost
We should have no ending, no limits to a sky
Rather hear a good night, let's not say goodbye

We should take what's left and make it right
(We're gonna make it right)
We should sleep all day and stay up all night
(We're staying up all night)

See you from a distance, you're not close enough
My heart is a mountain, you're diamond in the rough
We should have no ending, no limits to a sky
Rather hear a good night, let's not say goodbye

We should take what's left and make it right
(We're gonna make it right)
We should sleep all day and stay up all night
(We're staying up all night)
