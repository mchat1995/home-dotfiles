Dust on dust, in a new room
First impressions of the sun
Burnt the skin now are buried
We've been staring up too long

Eyes gone dry. No more tears
Salt and shame upon my tongue
Dust on dust, drying flowers
We've been coming here too long

Here in the golden mirror
Watch every word you say
Shatter and find a way
To cut like golden days

Flesh on flesh on the dry earth
Our reflections are the same -
Wearing dust, match the desert
Past is captured as it's made

In your image, like an actress
Lying to protect her age
Dust on lens. Dying flowers
We shall not return again

Here in the golden mirror
Watch every word you say
Shatter and find a way
To cut like golden days

You're watching as I fade
Fading as I'm watching every word I say
Loving how I fade, fading like a flower
Knowing that the rain...

That the rain may fall too late
It can't revive my dying flowers
Oh the rain may fall...
Too late. This is our final hour

Here in the golden mirror
Watch every word you say
Shatter and find a way
To cut like golden days

You're watching as I fade
Fading as I'm watching every word I say
Loving how I fade, fading like a flower
Knowing that the rain

Here in the golden mirror
Watch every word you say
Shatter and find a way
To cut like golden days
