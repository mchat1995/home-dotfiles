From the east to the west, we been killing all the fake shit
I'mma bring it like one, two, three, four

Far east and across the globe
Anybody heavy metal holding down your own, for sure
Be the witness of this lit mess
Ape shit, ape shit

Dropped out, self-taught, ain't nobody gave a fuck
Look now, decked out, devil users where you at
They be tryna hate me, well, I'm not complaining
I've outgrown the parties, bitches and sake

Street lights they shine our home
Godzilla every day back in Tokyo
'Cause the mark of the beast has been carved right upon me
Ape shit, ape shit

Neon lights we're walking through
The rising sun we see in the west

I'm self-made and I know 'cause I'm jaded
Now I've taken control
I'm self-made and I know 'cause I made it
Watch your back against the world, where the city never sleeps for us

Neon lights we're walking through
The rising sun we see in the west

Godzilla taking over your cities
We've outgrown these parties like bitches and sake

I'm self-made and I know 'cause I'm jaded
Now I've taken control
I'm self-made and I know 'cause I'm jaded
Now I've taken control

Neon lights we're walking through
The rising sun we see in the west
Neon lights we're walking through
The rising sun, let's go

I'm self-made and I know 'cause I'm jaded
Now I've taken control
I'm self-made and I know 'cause I made it
Watch your back against the world, where the city never sleeps for us
