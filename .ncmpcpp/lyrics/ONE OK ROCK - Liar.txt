What do you want from me? just let me breathe a little
What do you want to see? me ni mieru mono?
What do you want to believe? still nothing can be settled
Hold on to your words you say it's no good

Nani mo motome soshite nani wo ukeireru?
Futatsu ni hitotsu!! boku ni wa mada sore ga I don't know
Tonari de warau kimi wa

Hey liar, hey liar
What do you think of living without me?
Hey liar, hey liar
Nani ga uso de dore ga shinjitsu

Must be a dream I see maru de déjà vu no you
Trying so hard to know inside of you
Staring your eyes to feel kono omoi ga todoku you ni to
Negau kedo risou to wa urahara so cold
Tonari de hohoemu kimi…

Hey liar, hey liar
Are mo kore mo uso ja mou
I'm tired, so tired
What do you think of living without me?

There is nothing left to bleed
My heart can't take this any more

Hey liar, hey liar
What do you think of living without me?
Nee liar, oh yeah liar
Todomaru koto wa muimi?
