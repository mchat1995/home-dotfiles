"Now this means War!

Armys are gathering out in the plain
The soldiers prepare to die
Blinded by greed and the weapons of steel
Look out; this challenge is real
The hatred is here but we have to be wise
Cities have to burn
Break through the enemy lines

Heed the call for civil war
We're the legion of the dark
Mortal fight for what is right
The faith is stronger than steel
Heed the call for civil war
By the moon and the stars and the wind and the rain
Mortal fight for what is right
Say your prayers, cause now it's time to believe
Set us free


Fighting on land and raging at sea
This war is a battle of minds
A game of control on blood painted soil
Wake up; the weak may be strong
At difficult times they feed us with lies
There is no remorse
And the white flag is burning tonight

Heed the call for civil war
We're the legion of the dark
Mortal fight for what is right
The faith is stronger than steel
Heed the call for civil war
By the moon and the stars and the wind and the rain
Mortal fight for what is right
Say your prayers
Don't you know that they feed us with lies?


Heed the call for civil war
We're the legion of the dark
Mortal fight for what is right
The faith is stronger than steel
Heed the call for civil war
By the moon and the stars and the wind and the rain
Mortal fight for what is right
Say your prayers, cause now it's time to believe
It's civil war
