Can we make sense of it all?
The lies our fathers told
To find the beauty in the sorrow

So young, did it even matter?
So young, did it even matter?

It felt so strange, living in my grave
Count each breath, waiting to expire
Remember home, dying here alone
Hollow words, anthems from the choir

Can we make sense of it all?
The lies our fathers told
To find the beauty in the sorrow

The lies they told
Can we make sense of it all?
The beauty in the sorrow

So young, did it even matter?
So young, did it even matter?

It felt so strange, looking at your grave
An early end, I read letters to remember
So I moved on or so the story goes
Shots rang out, red flowers; a reminder

Can we make sense of it all?
The lies our fathers told
The beauty in the sorrow

The beauty in the sorrow

The beauty in the sorrow

So young, did it even matter?
So young, did it even matter?

Can we make sense of it all?
The lies our fathers told
To find the beauty in the sorrow

The lies they told
Can we make sense of it all?
The beauty in the sorrow
