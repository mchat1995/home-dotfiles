Hi baby
I know you're under a lot of pressure at your work and all
And I do understand
You have no idea how much I understand
But you also don't have any idea how much I love you
I love you so much
I think about you I feel you in my arms
I miss you, I miss you terribly
I've just always wanted someone like you in my life
I love you so much that I'd do anything, I'd do anything
I'll be your perfect woman for you

I just wanna fuck bad bitches
All them nights I never had bitches
Now I'm all up in that ass bitches
Mad at your boyfriend, ain't 'cha?
You'se a bad girl, gotta spank ya
Gotta thank ya for that head clinic
Explicit, hella photogenic
And tell your friends where the dick's at
Where they can get hit and won't get back to they soulmate
Before you kiss 'em use Colgate
She swallowed it, yeah the bitch took the whole eight
And ran with it, then let Mel-Man hit it
And Hittman hit it, damn bitches
Man, this is what I'm talkin' about
Chicken head, chicken fed with a dick in yo' mouth
Out and about with your nigga like it never took place
(Airtouched) Next time you need a taste

Devin the Dude:
I just wanna fuck you, no touching and rubbing girl
You've got a husband who loves you
Don't need you all in mine
I just wanna fuck you, we can't be kissing and hugging girl
You've got a husband who loves you
You need to give him your quality time

You got the number, it's on you to make the call
You know I come quick help you redecorate your walls
Cut your backyard, don't have to act hard to get the cock
And if I'm going too far, I take it out and wipe it off
And put it back up, and keep going
You tryin' to hide it from your husband but I know he be knowin'
That your pussy's been tampered with
Did you show him the new trick of how you can make it smoke a cancer stick?
You be workin it like a dancer, bitch, it's hard on me
Not to give you all of my time that you wanted
You can give me some head, but keep the breakfast in bed
I'd rather spend my morning digging through some records instead
But, tonight I guess it'd be aight if we can touch bases
Hook up somewhere and exchange some Fuck Faces
I know your man's looking for ya, he's always trying to run ya
Don't worry 'bout me handcuffing girl 'cause I just wanna

Snoop Dogg:
Fuck witchu
On the sneak tip, on some creep shit
So whatcha gon' do, you freak bitch?
You acting like you don't do dicks
That's the kinda bitch I hate fuckin' with
Baby was a virgin, that's what she said
So I gave her some Hennessy, she gave me some head
I fucked her on the floor so I wouldn't mess up my bed
Then Lil half-dead put his dick on her head
Take that bitch home and give her a bone
And give her the number to my cellular phone
Now she's blowing up my pager, the shit's gettin' major
A favor for a favor, this dick is what I gave her
Something to go by and bitches know why
Stuff dick in they mouth and then I'm out (See-ya)
24/7, Dre, Snoop and Devin
We serving these hoes and never loving these hoes

Devin the Dude:
I just wanna fuck you, no touching and rubbing girl
