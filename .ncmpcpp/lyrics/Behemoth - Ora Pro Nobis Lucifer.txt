E Viva L'Arte! Viva Blasfemia!

Voice ov an aeon!
Angelus Satani!
Ora pro nobis lucifer!
You alone have suffered.

The fall and torment ov shame
I'll smite heaven's golden pride
And never pity thee
Immaculate divine

Satan ov Elohim!
None dare to stand in your way!
Thou bow to none.
Ov eden's feculence.

Conjure the serpent messenger
Savior world's decay
Concord in temptation
And in the fall ov Eve!

For thine is the kingdom!
And the power!
For thine is the kingdom!
And the glory!
Forever!

Scholar ov the unlight
Great volcano ov excrement
Rippling eager to erupt
Reconstellate the firmament

Behold the great accuser
A megalinga ov throbbing zeal
Raptor yearning to pierce
To rape the seventh seal

Destroyer ov cosmos
Implore the ungod
Implode the sun
There is none wronging the
Serpent's cult

Untouched and ignored
With the serpent's might
And the trumpets blow
In the shadows ov the horns

For thine is the kingdom!
And the power!
For thine is the kingdom!
And the glory!
Forever!

Lightning that stabs the heavens,
Thou quiver the mount Sinai!
Split rocks on tablets ov covenant!
Listen for the tempest's rasp!

Azazel! appolyon!
The black sun never sets!
For it never rose!

Habemus satanas!
The caesar's wrath,
Empire's fall!
Petition the lord with fire
Santa sede burns

Phallus dei!
Erect from pole to pole!
Viva blasfemia!
In coitus infinitus!

Hear the universe scream!
Bleeding from black holes,
Whom horns caress?
And whom god mourns?
