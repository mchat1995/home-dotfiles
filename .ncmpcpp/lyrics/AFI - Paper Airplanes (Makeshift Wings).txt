Raise high monolithic
Statues so fragile as they fall
I am
Ever enthralled
Gaze, lie and smirk in time
Your arrogance will suit you well
'Til fashion
Is dispelled
As waves of plastic fame
Go out of fashion
You're going out, going out
Forever unknown
These waves of plastic fame
Go out of fashion
You're going out, going out
Forever unknown
Unknown
From above
A rain of ashes
Descends anathema
I will remain, forever will remain
From below
In my seclusion
Look up to the sky to see (Paper wings)
See wings and watch them burn

Without habitation
You'll never find a soul inside
No life
But nothing's died
No lights, but quite the show
Just as long as no one ever knows
All motion
Is pantomime
As waves of plastic fame
Go out of fashion
You're going out, going out
Forever unknown
These waves of plastic fame
Go out of fashion
You're going out, going out
Forever unknown
Unknown
From above
A rain of ashes
Descends anathema
I will remain, forever will remain
From below
In my seclusion
Look up to the sky to see (Paper wings)
See wings and watch them burn

Dancing in the rain of descending ash
Dancing on your grave
I'll see you (All falling)
Dancing in the rain of descending ash
Dancing in your dust
I'll see you (All falling)
(Stop!)
I'd stop it, had you a heart
(Your! Heart!)
I'd stop it, had you a heart
(Your! Heart!)

From above
A rain of ashes
Descends anathema
I will remain, forever will remain
From below
In my seclusion
Look up to the sky to see (Paper wings)
See wings and watch them burn
From above
A rain of ashes
Descends anathema
I will remain, forever will remain
From below
In my seclusion
Look up to the sky to see (Paper wings)
See wings and watch them burn
(Oh, watch 'em)
