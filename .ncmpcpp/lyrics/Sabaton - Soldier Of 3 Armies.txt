Started out as a reserve,
Soon promoted well deserved,
And the legend has begun
With a bounty on his head
The Red Army wants him dead
Soviet enemy number one

Cross of Mannerheim!
Addicted to the war game
Never ending flame
Victory reclaimed
Oh, we remember
We remember, we remember!

Shout, Lauri Törni's name
A soldier of 3 armies knows the game
Deeds that echo from the past
Rise! from beyond your grave
Son of Finland and a green beret
May you rest in peace at last
Lauri Allan Törni

Crossed the water a new start
War still beating in his heart
A new legend has been born
Started out as a reserve
Soon promoted, well deserved
Changed his name to Larry Thorne

Cross of Mannerheim!
Addicted to the war game
Never ending flame
Victory reclaimed
Oh, we remember
We remember, we remember!

Shout, Lauri Törni's name
A soldier of 3 armies knows the game
Deeds that echo from the past
Rise! from beyond your grave
Son of Finland and a Green Beret
May you Rest in Peace at last
Lauri Allan Törni!

From the Finnish lakes
Into Germany and USA
All the wars he came across
Cross of Mannerheim, an Iron Cross
A Bronze Star, Purple Heart
One Distinguished Flying Cross

Shout, Lauri Törni's name
A soldier of 3 armies knows the game
Deeds that echo from the past
Rise! from beyond your grave
Son of Finland and a Green Beret
May you rest in peace at last
Lauri Allan Törni!
