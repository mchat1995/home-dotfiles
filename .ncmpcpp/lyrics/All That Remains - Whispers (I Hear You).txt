It may seem at last, days passing mean nothing,
But the sun that sets cause only pain.
Violence in words, like slashes, wound deeply,
Love is not when you feel only pain.

Her touch,
Poison
Flows through my veins
No more,
I denounce all your childish games.

Whispers, (I hear your)
Poison, (flows in me)
Lost inside you, I'm not free of you.
Break my bonds again.

Love lost,
Arrogant whore,
Paint strife on this canvas.
Failure,
I am a fool, I should have seen.

Whispers, poison,
Break my bonds again. (break my bonds again)
Love lost, failure,
I should have seen,
I should have seen.

Whispers, (I hear your)
Poison, (flows in me)
Lost inside you, I'm not free of you.
Break my bonds again.

No more
Lies.
No more
Lies.

No more
Lies.
No more,
No more lies!

It may seem at last, days passing mean nothing,
But the suns that set cause only pain.
Violence in words, like slashes, wound deeply,
Love is not when you feel only pain.

No more regrets,
Face my fear alone.
You made me whole,
This I believe,
Break these bonds again.

Whispers (I hear your)
Poison, (flows in me)
Lost inside you, I'm not free of you.
Break my bonds again.

Lost inside you, I'm not free of you.
Break my bonds again.
