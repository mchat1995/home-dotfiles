(Thalia)
Destabilization complete, prepare for departure

(Kai)
Took you long enough

(Thomas)
Oh, I'm sorry, your highness. I'll have to try and ask the asteroid field I had to detour through to not try and kill me next time

(Kai)
Man, I'm just messing with you

(Thomas)
Yeah, whatever

(Kai)
So what'd you do on the way over here?

(Thomas)
Um, you know, just listening to some oldies

(Kai)
Oldies? Like who?

(Thomas)
Logic

(Kai)
Logic? The fuck you know about Logic?

(Thomas)
I just listened to his first album on the ride over

(Kai)
Under Pressure?

(Thomas)
Yeah, that's the one

(Kai)
Shit...

(Thomas)
I was actually gonna put in the second one now

(Kai)
All right, well you know this was the album that changed everything, right?

(Thomas)
I know, that's why it's so important
