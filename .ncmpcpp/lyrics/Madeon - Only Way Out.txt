I swore my all-in
Through stormy weather, when you're falling
Light as a feather, I'll be calling
And I won't leave your side
And I know you think that we're done for
If you let me, I'll bring you comfort
Give you something to take away the pain

There's no other way, no
You are my only way out
And since we came here together
We'll leave with each other, now
When no one else is around
I'll lift you back off the ground
And since we came here together
We'll leave with each other now

I've made my mind up
There's no way to change it
We have forced through too many stages
And I've caught you
And I won't leave your side
You are the only way out, so love
I won't give up my promise
No, I won't leave you on your own

There's no other way, no
You are my only way out
And since we came here together
We'll leave with each other, now
When no one else is around
I'll lift you back off the ground
And since we came here together
We'll leave with each other now

There's no other way, no
You are my only way out
And since we came here together
We'll leave with each other, now
When no one else is around
I'll lift you back off the ground
And since we came here together
We'll leave with each other now
