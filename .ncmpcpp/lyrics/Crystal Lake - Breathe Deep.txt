We sink
We drown in sorrow to hide
After the lapse in time as thoughts intertwine
Again we sink
We drown in our ocean of tears
If your pain's not mine
Then my pain's not yours

If we can feel each other
Don't let it go
We got so much in common
The shore is not so far

This is growing up as we dream of dying young
Breathe in and out the moments we make
We're not alone
Start over again

You sink you drown to stumble and fall
Before you stop and think to recapture each step

You are afraid that time could leave you behind
But you're facing forward as you're looking back
So go and sink to swim
Set your sorrows aside
I know you fought but lost
Still you're here just the same (the same)
Sometimes we forget that we can never live forever, ever
No
We're not invincible
We can call that "miracle"

That's why we need each other
Don't let it go
We got so much in common
The shore is not so far

This is growing up as we dream of dying young
Breathe in and out the moments we've made We're not alone
Start over again

So don't be afraid (to) start over again
