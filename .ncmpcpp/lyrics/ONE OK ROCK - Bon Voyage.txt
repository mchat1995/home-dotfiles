It took some time to realize
That things are not getting better
We should know, we should know
It's over

You're seeing the other side of me
We tried to weather the weather
We should know, we should know
That night's gone

熱が二つを引き合わせ
冷めてしまえば
Never getting better

I know things won't change
I'm saying bon voyage
Down to the line
Down to the line
It's time to sail

We're stuck on repeat
I'm saying bon voyage
Down to the line
Down to the line
I'm letting go

I hope you find another life
Maybe you'll start getting better
We should know, we should know
It's over

I miss the days I spent alone
Before we lived together
We should know, we should know
That time's gone

熱が二つを引き合わせ
冷めてしまえば
Never getting better

I know things won't change
I'm saying bon voyage
Down to the line
Down to the line
It's time to sail

We're stuck on repeat
I'm saying bon voyage
Down to the line
Down to the line
I'm letting go
