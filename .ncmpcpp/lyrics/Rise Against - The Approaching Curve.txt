Spoken
The music played with a calming frequency
The speakers gently seeped the sounds of ambient keyboards and light percussion
Creating a seductive soundtrack to our midnight drive through curtains of blackness
The windows were cold to the touch, reflecting the icy conditions in our immediate extremity
Salt stains and fingerprints littered the glass, and streaks with melted snow cascaded down its length
The music pulsed louder, yet gentle, like the far away squeal of a pot of boiling water
The skylight was glowing faintly with a vague hints of an impending dawn
The car raced along a painfully straight stretch of road
And she hadn't so much as turned the steering wheel two degrees in the last twenty minutes
Nor had we spoken

As we were, so perfect, so happy
They'll remember, only our smiles 'cause that's all they've seen
Long since dried, when we are found, are the tears in which we had drowned
As we were, so perfect, so happy

Spoken
"Why are you doing this?" she spoke as if not expecting a response
Her voice penetrated the still air of our speechless drive, so sudden that my heart had jumped
"I'm not doing anything," I said, but I didn't even believe that myself
"This is what's best, for me, for you, for us" or maybe just for me, I thought
As a tear formed in the pit of her eye. The music poured through the speakers
And we were losing ourselves in the cadence 
She looked down momentarily and closed her eyes for a bit longer than a standard blink
Then she was crying. Then she was shouting
Then I was shouting, now pouring confessions, having no answers, or solutions
we barely even knew the questions

As we were, so perfect, so happy
They'll remember, only our smiles 'cause that's all they've seen
Long since dried, when we are found, are the tears in which we had drowned
As we were, so perfect, so happy

Don't put me underground, I was meant for a life somewhere else
Please, love, give me the Wheel, before both of our hearts you...
Will steal tonight (will steal tonight)

As we were, so perfect, so happy
They'll remember, only your smiles 'cause that's all they've seen
Long since dried, when we are found, are the tears in which we had drowned
As we were, so perfect, so happy

Spoken
Our cracking voices became part of the music
The car pressed on faster through the night
As our voices lowered the cadence again overtook the air
Up ahead there was a curve approaching
She made no indications of slowing
