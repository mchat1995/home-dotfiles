You've got me trapped in corners
Think I have nowhere to go
But I'll show you, first thing I do
You've got me oh so wrong


You've got me trapped in corners
Think I have nowhere to go
But I'll show you, first thing I do
You got me fucking wrong

Let's go

The never ending story of
How you bring me up, just to bring me pain
Where we going? Seems around
I've had it up, things will never ever change

Say you changed enough for reasons
We can't seem to forget
If you want a story
Here it is

You'd love me
To stay here
I hate you
Can you admit you're wrong?
No never
It's like you said

The never ending story of
How you bring me up, just to bring me pain
But this is just one of your games
I've had it up, you will never ever change
Uh baby
Try to picture moving on
I wanna picture worth my time
A thousand words for every tear of mine

Chasing myself in circles
When will this finally end
絵に描いたような恐怖に

追われ 過ごした
出口の無いループ繰り返し
回る
It's like you said

The never ending story of
How you bring me up, just to bring me pain
But this is just one of your games
I've had it up, you will never ever change
Uh baby
Try to picture moving on
I wanna picture worth my time
A thousand words for every tear of mine

I'm going through stages
Like roaming through pages
誰もが自分を見失う
そんな時は日々の喧噪から離れて
見渡せば そこには ほら今の君が写るから

Over and over again
It's like we're looking and searching for sin
Or something that will take this
Pain away from my brain
So you're talking and yapping and lips are moving but
I am free
You? none

You'd love me
To stay here
I hate you
Can you admit you're wrong?
No never
It's like you said

The never ending story of
How you bring me up, just to bring me pain
But this is just one of your games
I've had it up, you will never ever change
Uh baby
Try to picture moving on
I wanna picture worth my time
A thousand words for every tear of mine

The never ending story of
Where we go we seems around
The never ending story of
But this is just one of your games
