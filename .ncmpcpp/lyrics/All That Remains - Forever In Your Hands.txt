I know that I can stand my head high
Forget not where I fall
Still I find why and reason

Yet that conflict still filling me
Mistrust, venom inside of me
I am not the man that you see
Just look inside me

Trust in me the way I trust in you
I know we could have done this together (done this together)
Believe in me, like I believed in you
My heart would be forever in your hands

How I (how I) miss February still
Now that this becomes a moment
Of all our failures

Yet that conflict still filling me
Mistrust, venom inside of me
I am not the man that you see
Just look inside me

Trust in me the way I trust in you
I know we could have done this together (done this together)
Believe in me, like I believed in you
My heart would be forever in your hands

Trust in me the way I trust in you
I know we could have done this together (done this together)
Believe in me, like I believed in you
My heart would be forever in your hands

Forever in your hands
Forever in your hands
