I’m sick jikaku he Ask
Afurekaeru Lies
Can you see it? This feelings…
Tsumetaku uchitsukeru Quiet
To you who gave all to me
Will you believe me once again?
My this disease
Before killing you
I want to take back blank days

[GOOFY STATE]
Self-hate
I fall in an infinite loop
Silent,Escapism,Lie
Unchangeable rotten root
To you who gave all to me
Will you believe me once again?
My this disease
Before killing you
I want to take back blank days

Lost day never undone
It undermines me
Kimi wo hanasanu you ni
Lost day never undone
It undermines me
Disappear before killing you
This [Derangement]

Silent,Escapism,Lie
Unchangeable rotten root

Bottom of my decaying mind
The fact that you gave
Day of the change
Never forget it
Next loop means death
Lost day never undone
It undermines me
Kimi wo hanasanu you ni
Lost day never undone
It undermines me
Disappear before killing you
This [Derangement]
