Landed on the hilltop
Soviet forces are in place
Awaiting orders

They were only 39
They were told to hold the line
In control

Sent into battle, came from the sky
Trapped on a mountain, and into the fire

Hold your ground
When you're fighting those who fight
Death is waiting on the hill
No surrender, shoot to kill
You have to hold your ground
Kill the warrior in your sight
Death is waiting on the hill
No surrender, shoot to kill

January 7th
Hold the hilltop at all costs
Follow orders

Holding their ground
To the final round
One by one

Fight through the sundown, into the night
Enduring the darkness, awaiting the light

Hold your ground
When you're fighting those who fight
Death is waiting on the hill
No surrender, shoot to kill
You have to hold your ground
Kill the warrior in your sight
Death is waiting on the hill
No surrender, shoot to kill

(Hey...)
Stand, hold your ground
Come around
Hostile land
Your last stand

Under fire, low on munition (Hold your ground)
Make your bullets count (Come around)
Push their warriors back down the mountain (Hostile land)
Rule the battlefront (Your last stand)

Sent into battle, came from the sky
Trapped on a mountain, and into the fire

Hold your ground
When you're fighting those who fight
Death is waiting on the hill
No surrender, shoot to kill
You have to hold your ground
Kill the warrior in your sight
Death is waiting on the hill
No surrender, shoot to kill
