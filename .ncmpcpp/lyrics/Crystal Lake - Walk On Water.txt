Time
We are running out of time as we endure this pain to carry on
We'll carry on

Ocean waves growing stronger
Learning to walk on water
Every step we've carried on our weight
We know this fundamental thoughts could alternate 'cause we keep going
Let the light shine on answers (as) ocean breeze blowing harder
As I feel the sky turn inside out
My heart beats fast in demand of a life in command to destroy all the ones who impose to an order
But everything's going to be ok
Won't let you fade away

Time
We are running out of time as we endure this pain to carry on
We'll carry on

With each step we're destined to find
We will survive with all that we've gained
We will survive
Standing at the cross road

Until the end of days
Won't let you fade away
Until the end
Our dreams can never let you walk away
Until the end
Our dreams will never let you walk away
Second hand is catching up

Time
We are running out of time as we endure this pain to carry on
We'll carry on

Drowning and falling further and under
We're not alone in spite of echoes of hate that they sing in the night
Take me back in time to bring me back to life

Time
We are running out of time as we endure this pain to carry on
We'll carry on

Carry on
We'll carry on
