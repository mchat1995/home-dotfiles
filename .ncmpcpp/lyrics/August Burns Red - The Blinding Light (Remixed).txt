The fear is what shelters them
It's what shades their eyes and muffles their ears
The fear is what shelters them
It's what shades their eyes and muffles their ears

Keep them inside
Lock them up in a closet known as home

In here no one can find them
In here no one can fill them with filth
In here no one can find them
In here no one can fill them with filth

They were born with the silverware
Clenched in their teeth (in their teeth)
They were born with the silverware
Clenched in their teeth (in their teeth)
They were born with the silverware
Clenched in their teeth (in their teeth)

And so help us, they will die with it too
And so help us, they will die with it too
They will die with it too
None of them will make anything of themselves

They don't need their own lives
The ones we have planned will work just fine
They don't need their own lives
The ones we have planned will work just fine

The world is a terrifying place
Without us they will never make it

They will never reach their potential
They will never ever surpass us
Without our watchful eye
They might just leave us behind
Without our watchful eye
They might just leave us behind
