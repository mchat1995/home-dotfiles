I felt for sure last night
That once we said goodbye
No one else will know these lonely dreams
No one else will know that part of me

I'm still driving away
And I'm sorry every day
I won't always love these selfish things
I won't always live not stopping

It was my turn to decide
I knew this was our time
No one else will have me like you do
No one else will have me, only you

You'll sit alone forever if you wait for the right time
What are you hoping for?
I'm here and now I'm ready, holding on tight
Don't give away the end, the one thing that stays mine

Amazing still it seems
I'll be twenty-three
I won't always love what I'll never have
I won't always live in my regrets

You'll sit alone forever if you wait for the right time
What are you hoping for?
I'm here and now I'm ready, holding on tight
Don't give away the end, the one thing that stays mine

You'll sit alone forever if you wait for the right time
What are you hoping for?
I'm here and now I'm ready, holding on tight
Don't give away the end, the one thing that stays mine
