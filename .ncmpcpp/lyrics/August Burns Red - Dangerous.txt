The end will come
The end will come

Some will say the end will come, but I know it's never ending
Words give meaning to my thoughts. What gives meaning to this feeling?

I know what I did. I know what I said
I know what I did. I know what I said

It's dangerous, so dangerous
I've made friends with a stranger. It's endangering us
It's dangerous, so dangerous
I've made friends with a stranger. It's endangering us

When what you love is taken away
You realize what you're made of
You'll have to find your way. You'll have to scream and claw at the air
You strapped your pack to your back and all the weight is yours to bear
The help we find is the hope we need. It's the hand that guides us back
We can will ourselves to remember our word, but we all too quickly forget

Along the way I got lost. Now the way back home is overgrown
This isn't an addictive thought, it's a ravenous feeling
(Ravenous feeling)
Conviction must be greater than life's afflictions
I follow in my own footsteps rather than following classical conditioning

I wish I had the will to keep my word

I'm looking back to face what's ahead. (It's dangerous)
I faced danger and it finally fled. (It's dangerous)
I'm looking back to face what's ahead. (It's dangerous)
I faced danger and it finally fled. (It's dangerous)
