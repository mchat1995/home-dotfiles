Ordinary men don't find their own way (Find their own way)
It's in the struggle that we can finally see
I'll never forget how I felt so far away
When fear waged war and wore down on me

What do you say when you can't get the words out?
Can you hear me? Don't let me down
What do you say when you can't get the words out?
Can you hear me? Don't let me down
Can you hear me? Don't let me down

Put your fear away
Push it off the edge so that left is who you are
Stand tall against the waves in the ocean
You must be brave when it's sink or swim

Rest comes to the weary
We're so tired of losing
(We're so tired of losing)

The sun will break through
You'll get what you need (You'll get what you need)
The sun will break through
You'll get what you need

Wait to speak until you find the words to say
They'll come, I promise they'll come
You'll hear them out loud without forcing the words out
Put all your fear away

Ordinary men don't find their own way
It's in the struggle that we can finally see
I'll never forget how I felt so far away
When fear waged war and wore down on me

Bravery will find you when your head is hung low
Your fear is like a fever; it too will go
