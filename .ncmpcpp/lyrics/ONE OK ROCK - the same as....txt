何気ない日々　just the same old thing
何が欠けて足りないか
気づかない wish that the more i can't run away from myself
I tried to show you i'm strong
Just get all along うまく甘えたい気持ちが
はたくそんな强がりにしか必ず
The shape of love is the same as your heart is
It doesn't matter who you are
So tell me my heart is the same as yours is

さりげなくもらうその愛情はとてもふかかいで
素直には受け入れられ
何かをまだ閉ざしたまま
No matter how much you say I can't escape
今何かを変えてことで
この先に広がる何かを変える
The shape of love is the same as your heart is
It doesn't matter who you are
So tell me my heart is the same as yours is
たとえ儚くとも
悲しい時寂しい時、いつもそばにあるから
And we hold every moment cause that's what family is for

かけがえのないものを捨てる勇気なんて
僕にはこれこっちを持ち合わせてはないけど
時々なぜか手放して困らせたい時がある
今くれた怖いでのない僕
The shape of love is the same as your heart is
It doesn't matter who you are
So tell me my heart is the same as yours is
たとえ儚くとも
悲しい時寂しい時、いつもそばにあるから
And we hold every moment cause that's what family is for

Gone too far for so long
Got to find you've been right here all along
(i wanna take you away from here)

この世界中で何があると
僕を愛してくれて
いつでもそっと優しくそっと
見守り続けてる
強くく弱く時に厳しく
暖かな温もり
And we hold every moment cause that's what family is for
The shape of love is the same as your heart is
Tell me my heart is the same as yours is
Tell me my heart is the same as yours is
