Soldier boy, pick up your gun
Send me to my grave
As the world is breaking down
Where life to you is a battlefield
This country we try to steal
While the world is breaking down
Violent night, this can't be right
A vision clear and bright
In the end we're all just children of the earth
So life will be a killing ground
And this nightmare's still around
And the world is breaking down
A seed of the crime
A sign of the time
Eternity decide
On African soil, urban battleground
Two Blackhawks going down

Forevermore
We must live to testify
Forevermore
We are, just liars
Forevermore
They are children of the gun
Forevermore

We are disciples

Soldier boy, real McCoy
Medal made of gold
But their hearts not made of steel
I'm dying in the desert night
Overpowered by firemight
And no man is made of steel
Man and his clan
Man and his men
Warriors of mankind

What can we do, this is suicide
Divided we must fall

Forevermore
We must live to testify
Forevermore
We are, just liars
Forevermore

They are children of the gun
Forevermore
We are disciples

Forevermore
We must live to testify
Forevermore

We are, just liars
Forevermore
They are children of the gun

Forevermore
We are disciples
Forevermore
Now we must live to testify

Forevermore
We are, just liars
Forevermore
They are children of the gun
Forevermore
We are disciples
Forevermooore
We are disciples
Forevermooore
We are just liars
Forevermore...
