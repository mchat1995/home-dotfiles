How I regret what I must do
But you left me no choice
Though I still strain, I can't recall
The beauty of your fey voice

Now that I've heard come through the walls
A song I've heard many times
I must return all you gave me
In the company of swine

We had found
Sacred ground
Oh, we had found
Sacred ground you burnt down

I thought you sang so tastefully
But now I see I was wrong
Your serenade turns to filth when I leave
So, please, cut the love song

How I regret what I must do
But you must be replaced
For I cannot go on suffering
Such simple and common taste

When you met my eyes you sang to me
Of passion, pain and will
When I blinked you turned away
To kiss the hand of filth

We had found
Sacred ground
Oh, we had found
Sacred ground I'll burn down

I thought you sang so tastefully
But now I see I was wrong
Your serenade turns to filth when I leave
So please, cut the love song

Will hear 
Your voice
Your song
When the smoke 
Has cleared
And the lights
Have gone
Tell me who
Appears when I'm gone

I thought you sang so tastefully
But now I see I was wrong
Your serenade turns to filth when I leave
So please, cut the love song

I thought you sang
So tastefully
I see, I was wrong
Your serenade turns to filth when I leave
So please, cut the love song
(Cut the love song) cut the love song
