Pushed up against the ropes
You wouldn't last another round

You would not listen

Pushed up against the ropes
You wouldn't last another round
I never wished for you to suffer like this
You would not listen

We will survive
The strong
The fortunate
The never ending
We will survive
Through thick and thin

We will survive
The strong
The fortunate
The never ending
We will survive
Through thick and thin

Looking in the mirror
Seeing a trouble reflection (reflection, reflection)
This is our darkest hour
This is our darkest hour
Darkest hour

Remember what you said
When we waved our goodbyes
Remember what you said
When we waved our goodbyes

We're all dead in the end
So live life while you can
So live life while you can

You've abandoned all of us
You've abandoned me
You've abandoned all of us
You've abandoned me
You've abandoned all of us

We've forgiven you
So forgive yourself
We've forgiven you
So forgive yourself
We've forgiven you
So forgive yourself

We will survive
The strong
The fortunate
The never ending
We will survive
Through thick and thin

Pushed up against the ropes
You wouldn't last another round
I never wished for you to suffer like this
You would not listen

I have little sympathy for this divorce story
Stand in front of the jury
With no happy ending
With no happy ending
With no happy ending
With no happy ending
With no happy ending
