Every night devise new heights in genocide
Lover, I am loveless
All my friends and I toast health and suicide
Lover, I am lonely

Were you holding hands when
My palms bled?

Oh, I will be all right, just use me, just use me
The future's bright without me
Spend some time walking the line

World is unified, ennui, and I divide
Lover, I am loveless
Red days and burning might bleed till, till the faceless die
Lover, I am lonely

Were you holding hands when
My wrists bled?

Oh, I will be all right, just use me, just use me
The future's bright without me
Spend some time walking the line
Spend some time walking the line

So stay sweetly numb
Remain lifeless, love
So stay sweetly numb
Maintain lifeless love

Stay sweetly numb
Remain lifeless, love

Were you holding hands when
My palms bled?

Oh, I will be all right, just use me, just use me
The future's bright without me
Spend some time walking the line
Spend some time walking the line

Then I'll Be Home (Interlude)

I can't find either one of them now
Uh, Dad's here

I can't find either one of them
Ok, where are you?

I can't find either one of them
Uh, Dads here

I can't find either one of them
Wait-what are you doing?

Because I'm asking for a simple favor and 
She wont even do that, and so 
I may help him out 
And then I'll be back home
