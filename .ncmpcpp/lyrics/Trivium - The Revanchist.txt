I've been waiting here on the outside
I've been watching you from afar

The color of your fear, confusion deep inside
Resentment boils over, in me you can confide
You say you've lost your world, you say you've lost your faith
I'll be the shelter in the dark, clothe you in my hate

Profiteers and preachers
Sycophants and leachers

The Revanchist, his thoughts become mine
How deep they become intertwined
He said, "Submit for salvation, submit for salvation"
The age old lie

Submit for salvation

I've been calling you from the twilight
I've been pushing you to the edge

The way you say my name, the poison on your tongue
The lies they tell, pay no mind; I am the only one
You never turned you back, you didn't need to see
Cause even in the dead of night, you found your way to me

Profiteers and preachers
Sycophants and leachers

The Revanchist, his thoughts become mine
How deep they become intertwined
He said, "Submit for salvation, submit for salvation"
The age old lie

Submit for salvation

I've been waiting here on the outside
I've been watching you from afar

The color of your fear, confusion deep inside
Resentment boils over, in me you can confide
You say you've lost your world, you say you've lost your faith
I'll be the shelter in the dark, clothe you in my hate

Profiteers and preachers
Sycophants and leachers

The Revanchist, his thoughts become mine
How deep they become intertwined
He said, "Submit for salvation, submit for salvation"
The age old lie

He said, "Submit for salvation, submit for salvation"
The age old lie

Submit for salvation
