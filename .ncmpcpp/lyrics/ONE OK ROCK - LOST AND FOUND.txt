More expectation
Instead of singing in the blue sky
I was like a bird captured in a dungeon cage
Spread my confession
All of the good and bad deeds I have done
There was just too much I lost

Break the cage
Though I'm still bare I'll fly for the new true
When the beat beats my heartbeat

I know that I am dead still standing
Though my body's shaking sweating like woo
I can almost taste the hate the rage the morn the longer
I stare into the eyes of my own
And feel my bloodstream gushing vividly inside

Too many questions
The paper thin relationship can be torn with a stroke
Wanna trust no more
Just wanna let you know
Seems like yesterday
When I was a little boy gazing in the sky

But wake up game is up
I am back for revenge
When the beat beats my heartbeat

I know that I am dead still standing
Though my body's shaking sweating like woo
I can almost taste the hate the rage the morn the longer
I stare into the eyes of my own
And feel my bloodstream gushing vividly inside

I come to you again
Here I got something new but I can't reach for your touch
You must think you're losing all your mind
Sometimes you're lost
But you will be found

I know that I am dead still standing
Though my body's shaking sweating like woo
I can almost taste the hate the rage the mourn the longer
I stare into the eyes of my own
And feel my bloodstream gushing vividly inside
