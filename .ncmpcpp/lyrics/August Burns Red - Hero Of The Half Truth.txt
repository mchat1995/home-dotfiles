Carry us from the brink
Keep us from becoming extinct

We let you into our worst nightmares
Spouting fiction that left us cowered and scared
Follow the guidelines and you'll save our lives
It's sad to see you're quickly choking, choking on your lies

You vulture
Choking on your lies (Choking on your lies)
You vulture
We see through your disguise

Wishing we could take it all back
The beasts in your pack are the worst ones to attack
Change course and use a different track
The beasts in your pack are the worst ones to attack

They will show no mercy
They will show no mercy

Abandonment harbors the most resentment
If truth is the backbone you keep on bending it
One day it will snap into pieces
So shattered you're never able to mend them
They are broken, you are broken

Heads bowed before us, the fearless crumble and crawl
Asking forgiveness, forgiveness from all
Use the anger, direct it within
This could have been, been prevented

What was completely divided will come together united
Under the wings of a movement, the wings of a movement

Wishing we could take it all back
Wishing we could take it all back
Change course and use a different track

We'll rip and shred every word you say, every word you say

We will show no mercy
We will show no mercy
We will show no mercy
We will show no mercy
