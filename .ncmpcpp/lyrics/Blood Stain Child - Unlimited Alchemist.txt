What can I do?
What should I do?
This life once long
Now runs too short to dream

Feel brave inside
I stand alone in this air
I cannot fall down yet
I might have still things to do
Here

The sister's burning glance
A tragic tale, a futile road of glass

Feel faith inside
When darkness rises and night comes
My life fades away
I am waiting for my...

Rise
I save your soul
I wanna try to magnify my sound
How many worlds lie in the future?
Awake
My wings embrace your story
Only one life
I am not scared at all

Under the honest sky
I breathe I pledge to live,
Waving my fears goodbye
Even if I break

Rise
I save your soul
I do not want to surrender
I will win, victory
Awake
You fly like a feather
Only one life
Wanna feel a taste of infinity

My dream... somewhere...
My sound... somewhere...
My voice... somewhere...
My life
Somewhere in the sky

I save your soul
I wanna try to magnify my sound
How many worlds lie in the future?
Awake
And save you from sorrow
Only one life
I'm not scared at all

Rise
I save your soul
I do not want to surrender
I will win, victory
Awake
My wings embrace your story
Only one life
Wanna feel a taste of infinity
