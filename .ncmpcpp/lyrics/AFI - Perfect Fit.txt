What was it I was thinking,
Was I even thinking at all?
When I think of what I thought back then,
Then I'm ashamed; and I'm appalled
That I gave up all I ever was so easily.
Living your life is not for me.

I won't be sedated, I won't be sedated!
Give me a little taste and I know I won't want more.
I won't be sedated, stability is overrated.
Give me the disorder I adore.

What was it you were thinking,
Were you even thinking at all?
When I think of what you thought of me,
I take offense; and I'm appalled
That you could discount all I love so easily.
Living our life is not for me.

I won't be sedated, I won't be sedated!
Give me a little taste and I know I won't want more.
I won't be sedated, stability is overrated.
Give me the disorder I adore.

I can't be a part,
Be a part,
I can't be a part.
I can't be a part,
Be a part of your modern world.

I've gotta be apart,
Be apart,
Gotta be apart.
I've gotta be apart.
I don't grasp the values that you hold.

I can't be a part,
Be a part,
I can't be a part.
I can't be a part,
Be a part of your modern world.

I've gotta be apart,
Be apart,
Gotta be apart.
I've gotta be apart.
I don't grasp the values that you hold.

I can't be a part,
Be a part,
I can't be a part.
I can't be a part,
Be a part of your modern world.

I've gotta be apart,
Be apart,
Gotta be apart.
I've gotta be apart.
I don't grasp the values.
