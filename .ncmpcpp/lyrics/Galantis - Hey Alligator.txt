Hold me tight and pull me under
You let me drown, you let me dream
We using, oh by now my heart is in your teeth
Hey alligator, have some mercy on me
(Have some mercy on me)

Gold blooded, hard headed, I love it, I can't escape you
Why do I come back for more? It's human nature
I'm rushing, oh by now my heart is in your teeth
Hey alligator, have some mercy on me
(Have some mercy on me)

Have some mercy on me

Lift me up, you take me higher
You let me down and fall so far
Rushing, oh by now your jaws won't let me breathe
Hey alligator, have some mercy on me
(Have some mercy on me)

Gold blooded, hard headed, I love it, I can't escape you
Why do I come back for more? It's human nature
I'm rushing, oh by now my heart is in your teeth
Hey alligator, have some mercy on me

I'm rushing, oh by now my heart is in your teeth
Hey alligator, have some mercy, have some mercy
Have some mercy on me
(Have some mercy on me)
Have some mercy on me
