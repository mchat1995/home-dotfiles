The cold comes with a sting, a sting across my hands
Cracking and breaking like the weight upon my chest
It took me years to figure out
It's what I needed, needed to survive
What I need to survive
My resolve will be revived

I discovered the cure for my misery
By spending time with the unforgiving
Something more, so much more
Graceful than anything, anything living

Alone with the wind is where I hide
As I find my place among the stars
This moment makes me feel alive
It's what I need to survive

Time stands still as my thoughts stop swimming (Time stands still)
Time stands still as my thoughts stop swimming (Time stands still)

My muscles may ache
My tendons may break
But tearing myself down to nothing has allowed
Me to become something more than this
Something greater
This is where I may seem lost but I promise you I'm more awake than ever, awake than ever
Facing up towards the never-ending expanse and finding my place among the stars

Alone with the wind is where I hide
As I find my place among the stars
This moment makes me feel alive
It's what I need to survive

Open soul, open mind
I'm finally focused on what's inside
I've gained a new perspective
Open soul, open mind
I'm finally focused on what's inside
I've gained a new perspective

Open soul, open mind
I'm finally focused on what's inside
I've gained a new perspective
