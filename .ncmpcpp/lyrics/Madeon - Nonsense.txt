I am here for you
Open up your eyes and don't look away
I'm dripping down from the fangs
When I hear your name, I feel the pain
And I'm crawling on the floor just thinking that I'm a fool
But I wash myself and I stand again
After flying with angels, yeah
And now I'm backing out the corner

And don't you think that I'm a runner
I'll be coming with my guns up
Shooting at the moon to bring the sun up

Fall back and close your eyes
I'm at the bottom, we can hide and be forgotten
Come closer, say my name
Say it forever, we can run away together
And keep on crushing on our love like this
On our love like this, on our love like this
I'll keep on crushing on our love like this
We don't need to say the words 'cause we're speaking nonsense

Well, you said before
To lay down and close my eyes when I'm here
Grabbing at my chest with a broken heart, yeah
And I'm filled with fear
I've been ripped up and tossed like a mouse
Wrestled with the heavens and the devil himself

Your voice can break my bones
And then you speak a force rushes in and slow
It rips me to pieces, yeah
Well I would give my life to another

Just to prove I'm not a runner
I'll be coming with my guns up
Shooting at the moon to bring the sun up

Fall back and close your eyes
I'm at the bottom, we can hide and be forgotten
Come closer, say my name
Say it forever, we can run away together
And keep on crushing on our love like this
On our love like this, on our love like this
I'll keep on crushing on our love like this
We don't need to say the words 'cause we're speaking nonsense

Don't say anything at all
I'm drifting down
I don't wanna get pulled out
Just get close to me, close to me

Fall back

And keep on crushing on our love like this
On our love like this, on our love like this
I'll keep on crushing on our love like this
We don't need to say the words 'cause we're speaking nonsense

Yeah
'Cause we're speaking nonsense
Non- nonsense
