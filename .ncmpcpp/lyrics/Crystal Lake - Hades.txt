Welcome to the jungle
This is just where we fight
The weak become the prey
Only the strongest survive
Come at me
Come and say what you wanna say
Face to face, here I stand
I won't run away

All the words you say are meaningless to me
'Cause you're hiding behind the mask of your conceit
Go tweet on Twitter
While I'm getting bigger
You'll never see a fire in my eyes
'Cause you are dead inside

Yeah! Say it, say it, say it
Yeah! Say it to my face
Yeah! What a poor little boy you are
Yeah! We'll fucking tear you up

Damn showtime motherfucker, it's on
I'm ready to drop this bomb on this fucking song
If you're 555 then I'm 666
Shut your fucking mouth and put your horns in the fucking air

Hey hey! You can run but you can't hide
Hey hey! Can't compare to how we grind
Hey hey! If you wish to stay alive?
Hey hey! Throw your sign up in the sky

Yeah! Say it, say it, say it
Yeah! Say it to my face
Yeah! What a poor little boy you are
Yeah! We'll fucking tear you up

Say what, say what
Step up, step up
Say what, say what
Step up motherfucker
You gotta live it to take credit and represent it

Bitches whining 'cause we're styling as we murder your pride
I got 99 problems, but a bitch ain't one
Hit me
Hit me if you dare

Yo, what's up motherfuckers
We got it from the chaos to the fucking core
We're from Tokyo
Running this shit since 2K-motherfucking-3
We're talking Crystal-fucking-Lake, motherfuckers
Burn it to the ground

We will tear you up
We will tear you down
Tear you down
