You flew away
Before I could say
Taken away before your time
Up into the clouds
ここからじゃ見えない　見えるはずもない
いくつの夜を越えても　もう君には会えない

Now you're gone
You left your song
What can I do with this pain
どんな歌を口ずさむ?
I hope you're smiling down
Now you're gone
You're really gone
歩むべき道は
もう互いに違うから
Face the truth
I will just sing for you

いつだってそう　何の前触れもなく
不意に僕らから全て奪った後
悲しみで涙が溢れる
Time just left you behind
And I don't know why
How can I accept
Something I don't understand

Now you're gone
You left your song
What can I do with this pain
どんな歌を口ずさむ?
I hope you're smiling down
Now you're gone
You're really gone
歩むべき道は
もう互いに違うから
Face the truth
I will just sing for you

Now you're gone
You left your song
What can I do with this pain
どんな歌を口ずさむ?
I hope you're smiling down
Now you're gone
You're really gone
歩むべき道は
もう互いに違うから
Face the truth
I will just sing for you
