Inner deformity, such a foul deceptive rot
Conceiving the grotesque. Nothing is but what is not
Screeds of verbiage, never explained. Gazing at the flames
Inside the dungeon or my skull, only mawkish thoughts remains

Grotesque addict, forever shadowed
Darkness clouding me. Absurdity now fate
Bizzarre dreams, an horrendous nightmare
Nothing left but to hallucinate

Dementia reigns, a predilection. Total order cease
Rescrudescent, this condition. Coherency decrease
Humanity is not to shine, in my bloodless face
Magnified in travesty, I have been displaced

See with the eye of the mind. That the lie will speak
Traumatic cracks in my addiction, made the future bleak
Paralysed to ruminate, embolismic bitter jest
Ontologically I'm dead, reborn as the grotesque
THE GROTESQUE!
