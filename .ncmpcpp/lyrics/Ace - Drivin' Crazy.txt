Drivin' crazy

Drivin' crazy
Drivin' crazy

Freakin' out
Tonight I'll shake the dust out of my mind
Power-drive
I'm turnin' like the wheel in the dance

Don't touch the brakes or you'll kill my desire
It's gonna get cool
I wanna get higher than hell

I feel like
Drivin' crazy
Runnin' through your soul
The speed of the fire
Drivin' crazy
Rage in the night
I feel like
Drivin' crazy
Runnin' through your soul
The speed of the fire
Drivin' crazy
Rage in the night
In the night

Stormin' out
The steel is cryin' loud on the wild side
Skid and slide
The danger is my favorite part

Don't touch the brakes or you'll kill my desire
It's gonna get cool
I wanna get higher than hell

I feel like
Drivin' crazy
Runnin' through your soul
The speed of the fire
Drivin' crazy
Rage in the night
I feel like
Drivin' crazy
Runnin' through your soul
The speed of the fire
Drivin' crazy
Rage in the night
In the night

Drivin' crazy
Drivin' crazy

Don't touch the brakes or you'll kill my desire
It's gonna get cool
I wanna get higher than hell

I feel like
Drivin' crazy
Drivin' crazy
I feel like
Drivin' crazy
Runnin' through your soul
The speed of the fire
Drivin' crazy
Rage in the night
In the night
