You're gone
You're lost in a world of your own design
Alone
Humanity's long since been left behind

And would you believe that I once felt your pain?
(Although it's far behind me now)
It seems so strange that in pain you still believe

And I see a light ahead
A template for all my ambitions
Life lays bare before
Meaning disinterested
I'm welcoming my liberation

Moral
You call me what you will and cast me away
I know
And in the depth of my ignorance I'm not afraid

And would you believe that I once felt your pain?
It seems so strange to me that in pain you still believe

And I see a light ahead
A template for all my ambitions
As a new day dawns
On an empty world
I'm welcoming my liberation

I'm alone in the world
A husk fading petty and destined
And I stay my mind
From futile tries at 
Reaching for exoneration

I'm lost in the stars above
Consumed in my reflection
Distracted from my condemnation
They join me in consciousness

I can't
Remember a time when days flickered
Like their cold light
Care passed like season
And love was free of all reason

My reason is as trivial
As senses pervaded by a final nostalgic scent
I inhale once more
Knowing the dreams I won't live don't mater

Leave it behind
