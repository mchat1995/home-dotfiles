Dying of the Light
A million faces search the sky
The universe was huge enough for us to hide
Drifting with the tide
A rite of passage to the stars
I always knew the days were through for us to shine

Live, love, fade out

Days and nights seem never ending
Space and time bleed into one

Hold on to the light
To stay awake
To live and learn
To keep your sanity
Trace forgotten smiles
To feel the rage and hear the tale
Of how the mission fell apart

Stay here by the light
To turn the page and feel the pain
Of being loved and left behind
Sing the Sun in flight
To be afraid and live in vain
Let the rest of us remain

Live, love, shut down

Days and nights seem never ending
Space and time bleed into one
Dreams of our two worlds connecting
Fade as soon as they've begun
