Install thy kingdom of glory
We're the servants, the servants of holy
Coded prayers, emptied souls, "blessed" by the plastic signs
Template hearts, salvation, the circle we trust

Behold the virgin spawning
The filth of the human race
From her womb, prolonged by machines

Obey and praise, reprogram your faith
Connect yourself and be absorbed by the hive

Implant the Lord, your God, enhanced the human race
Sequenced for your perfection, our perfection
Implant the Lord, your God, enhanced the human race
Sequenced for more perfection, give into system

Install thy kingdom of glory
We are the servants of holy

Implant the Lord, your God, enhanced the human race
Sequenced for your perfection, our perfection
Implant the Lord, your God, enhanced the human race
Sequenced for more perfection, give into system

The perversion of cognition
Subterfuge, mother to delusion; ruin

Rebirth

It's time to shed the flesh
Enslave your mind to be reborn for eternity

Install thy kingdom of glory
We are the servants of holy
In the circle we trust

Verily, the cry of this earth is great
And verily, the filth is exceedingly grievous
I have come down to see what they have done altogether

We were damned from the start, coded by prayers of emptied souls
(According to the cry of it which is come unto me)
Controlled by plastic signs and templated hearts (And now I know)
No salvation for humanity, the wicked and filthy (Now I know)
And still we will proclaim: in the circle we trust
(I'm watching the silence)
