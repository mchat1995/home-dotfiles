Looking down on the earth from the top
I see this way of this life you sustain
War goes on in the name of god
War goes on as my heart's about to break
Know that when you fall again
You will be the only one to blame
Evolution leads to destruction
Cause time will tell
Life is merely a fraction

With this fire in your hands

I watch you burn
Let it all burn
Everything you've got
And everything you love
Till the end I'll watch you burn
Let it all burn
This is the end
This is the end of our future

Till the end I'll watch you burn

This is a warning to you all
You will rise to surely fall
This is a warning to you all
This is a warning to you all

If your future becomes this singularity
Or this point of no return
Will you hide behind the inconvenient reality
Like itâ€™s a matter of no concern
Once this polarity turns upside down
Regularity turns inside out
Without a doubt
This is a warning to you all
You will rise to surely fall

Burn burn burn
Will you burn it down
You're not alone
We all burn together

The time has come
When you lose direction
Burn burn burn
Will you burn it down
It's out of control
We're heading to destruction
Burn burn burn
Will you burn it down
