崩れたBeauty 取り乱す背景
とてもじゃないけど笑えない
Night of pussy

造形の媚び　飲み込ます価値　麻痺したRealに笑えない
焼け付いた喉「もう飛べない」と君は言う

背に咲く「事情」抱き寄せても　きっと散らせないね
吐息に混ざる俺は偽善か愛か?

胸元から滲む目隠しの救い
零れそうな言葉　君には言えない
これ以上・・・　これ以上は・・・
溶けそうな身体と裏腹に　心は解け合えないから

歩けない君はやがて　また俺に縋ってくる
焼け付いた喉で「もう飛べない」そしてまた繰り返す

胸元から滲む目隠しの願い
零れそうな言葉　君に伝えたい
これ以上・・・　これ以上は・・・
溶けそうな身体と裏腹に　心は解け合えぬ

君はドレスをまとう
影を背負ったアゲハ
夢を奪った歓楽の砂漠で
貴方さえ・・・　貴方さえ・・・　と
俺を望んだ日々に付いた
消えぬ背の「重ね傷」と生きる

Angel who concealed wound. yeah!
Devil who licks the wound. yeah!

A collapsed Beauty distracted in a scenery
I can't really laugh at all
Night of pussy

I take in the modeled flattery, values paralyzed me and I can't really laugh
With your burned throat you say "I can't fly anymore"

Even if you embrace the "reasons" blooming on your back they surely won't disappear
Me who joins your sighs is that hypocrisy or love?

The relief in a blindfold is spreading from my chest
I can't say you the words that seem to overflow
Not less than this... Not less than this is...
My body seems to dissolve and in the contrary is my heart because it can't reconcile with it

You who can't walk will soon cling to me again
With your burned throat you say "I can't fly anymore" so you have to try it over again

The wish for a blindfold is spreading from my chest
I want to tell you the words that seem to overflow
Not less than this... Not less than this is...
My body seems to dissolve and in the contrary is my heart that can't reconcile with it

You're wearing a dress
A swallowtail burdened with a shadow
In the desert of pleasure that robbed your dream
Even you... even you... and
I'm attached to every day I was wishing for
You're living with "the lot of scars" on your back which can not fade away
