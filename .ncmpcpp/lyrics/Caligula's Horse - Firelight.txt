The stars will fade, the sun will rise
But I'll remember you were my firelight

The lucky ones, we were born
We will not be here for long
Been waiting on a sign of life
An "everything is alright"

Gone with the sun
Voices as one
And in the moment we will carry that light on

This is for the ones who burned
So short and so bright
I have never been so sure
You're firelight

How could this all last
When we burn so brightly?
Friends, give me your hands
Raise your voices with me

How could this all last
When we burn so brightly?

We'll escape like spark and shadow
Knowing that the world will end
I will say, "The stars will fade
The sun will rise, but I'll remember you were my firelight."

(X2) This is for the ones who burned
So short and so bright
I have never been so sure
You're firelight

(X2) How could this all last
When we burn so brightly?
Friends, give me your hands
Raise your voices with me

(X2) How could this all last
When we burn so brightly?
Friends, give me your hands
And remember with me
