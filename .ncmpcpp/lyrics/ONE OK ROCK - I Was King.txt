We said tonight
No going back
Nothing seems right
Stuck in the past

遠回りも寄り道も
すべてのことに意味があって
空回りもその痛みも
When am I, when am I
Gonna stop this dreaming?

When I was king
I was king
We had everything

When I was king
I was king
We had everything

Don't wanna go
I'm holding on tight
Something to live for
Make it our nights

(Shut down the sirens in our heads)

When I was king
I was king
We had everything

When I was king
I was king
We had everything

If I go down
I will go down fighting
I'll go down
Down like lightning

When am I when am I
Gonna start living?
When am I when am I
Gonna move on?
When am I when am I
Gonna kill this feeling?
When am I when am I
Gonna stop this dreaming?

When I was king
I was king
We had everything

When I was king...
