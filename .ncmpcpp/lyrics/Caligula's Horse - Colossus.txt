We wait
Close your eyes
Breathe in deep

We've met before
Your empty wall
No proof you ever existed
Paint your shadow if it brings you some small comfort
"I am still here"

The man who stood
Above the world
Learnt to fail
Is not to fall
Returns with two feet to the ground to say
"Fuck you, I've seen you
And you are very small"

"Be at peace"
He said - It's all in your head

We wait
Close your eyes
Breath in deep

Don't be afraid
Everything ends
So sing hallelujah
We're all dead anyway
Your perfect world's a fake

You are alive
You're breathing still
The liars tell you it's not the end
They're only dreaming
You'll be joining them soon
But I am still here

You are light
Just bathed in skin
Wait for what the world could give or take my hand
And stand with two feet to the ground and say
"Fuck you, I've seen you
And now I understand"

He said
"It's all in your head"

We wait
Close your eyes
Breath in deep

Don't be afraid
Everything ends
So back you lay
It was all in your head anyway
Your perfect world's a fake
