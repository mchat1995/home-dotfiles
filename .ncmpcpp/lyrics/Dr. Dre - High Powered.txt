Yo, yo what's up man?
Yo man gimme some of that old gangsta-ass shit, you know what I'm sayin'?
Some shit I can just kick back and smoke a fat-ass joint to, know what I'm sayin'?
Hell yeah, know what I'm talkin' about?
I like that old gangsta shit
'Cause you know it's a lot of niggas out there
Woofin all that bullshit talkin' 'bout they got this and got that
Talkin' louder than a motherfucker but ain't sayin' shit, heh, you know what I'm sayin'?

Yeah nigga I see your lips quivering
But you ain't sayin' a motherfucking thang
But my niggas, I got my niggas in the motherfuckin' house and they gon' tell you what's really goin' on
Got my motherfuckin' nigga RBX, definitely in this motherfucker
I got my nigga Daz in this motherfucker, ready to kick some real shit, know what I'm sayin'?
And that little shit you hear in the background, that's my homegirl Rage
So RBX kick this shit

RBX:
Seven execution style murders
I have no remorse 'cause I'm the fucking murderer
Haven't you ever heard of a killer?
I drop bombs like Hiroshima
So now I walk around strapped
One-time bust they caps and watch niggas collapse
Snap, adapt to this, but you need no adapter
This is just the first chapter
In a book from a crook
You get caught slipping, yo' ass gots to die
Nigga, tell me what the fuck you figure?
Trigger happy RBX to cap ya
Pump, pump, and I can't wait to bust a round
Pump, pump, my hollow point smacks the clown
'Cause what I said split his head
And now they got me runnin' from the Feds
But I refuse to go alive
It's kill or be killed, that's how real niggas survive, I'm high powered

Daz Dillinger:
Yeah, it's Daz that mass-murderin' motherfucker
So what you feel like you wanna get caught up?
Fool you better recognize
Death Row came to chastise
So if you cross the Row
Remember the first name is Death
No love for the other side
