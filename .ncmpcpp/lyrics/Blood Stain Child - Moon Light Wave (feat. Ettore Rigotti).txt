I cannot face this fallen world
(I cannot face this fallen world)
Shall we all burn eternally?
Forsake the emptiness of now
(Forsake the emptiness of now)
And throw yourself in the air

What is your dream?
(What is your dream?)
You whisper and...

Everything will fade away
My heart unwise dryin' tears astray
In the light-wave
(In the light-wave)
Every night I gaze at the silence in the sky

A virus called humanity
Shadows distort reality
And in our weaknesses we drown
Tonight
Transparent blue and lines unplanned
(Transparent blue and lines unplanned)
You're like a girl in wonderland

Where is your dream?
(Where is your dream?)
You asked me and...

Everything will fade away
My heart unwise dryin' tears astray
In the light-wave
(In the light-wave)
Every night I gaze at the silence in the sky

Love is crawling, find a way
Your heart like this moon light wave
In the rave day
(In the rave day)
Every time I feel that moon light fade away

Fade away

Everything will fade away...
Everything will fade away
My heart unwise dryin' tears astray
In the light-wave
(In the light-wave)
Every night I gaze at the silence in the sky

Love is crawling, find a way
Your heart like this moon light wave
In the rave day
(In the rave day)
Every time I feel that moon light fade away
(Fade away)
