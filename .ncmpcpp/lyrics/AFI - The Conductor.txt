Drop like the needle
Today I felt the drain
I'll climb back up to you
On ladders of the rain

Break them down, shake up their beliefs
I'll show them, show them a believer
Three hundred thousand amps
And I'm your warm receiver

When they kill the lights
You'll remain my conductor
And if they didn't drain your life
I'll become your conductor

Don't cut the connection

Bleed in to black clouds
And I will lick them clean
Turn to a tourniquet
And cinch yourself to me

Strike down now, shake their frail beliefs
And make them new born believers
Three hundred thousand amps
And I'm your warm receiver

When they kill the lights
You'll remain my conductor
And if they didn't drain your life
I'll become your conductor

When they kill the lights
You'll remain my conductor
You'll remain my conductor
You'll remain my conductor
