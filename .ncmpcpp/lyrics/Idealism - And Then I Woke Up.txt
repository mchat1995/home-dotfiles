Get into the car
Turn the radio up real far
To shut the noise
So I can hear my voice
There's a party on down the street
But nobody invited me 'cause I got a gig
Babysittin' my uncle's kids
Why me?
Whoa is me?

Don't they know that I'm a hip hop queen
A rock and roll dream
It's all bling bling
I'm the star on the scene
Yeah, check me out
See what I'm all about
I'm the one that you want, the one you can't have
The girl that you call that doesn't ever call back
Just look at me
I've got everything

But then I woke up

I was lying on the couch, drool comin' out my mouth
Turned on the t.v., Dr. Phil won't you please fix me
Waiting for the phone to ring, flipping through a magazine
Why doesn't he call?
Guess I'm the loser down the hall
Why me?
I just want to sleep

Don't they know that I'm a hip-hop queen
A rock and roll dream
It's all bling bling
I'm the star on the scene
Yeah, check me out
See what I'm all about
I'm the one that you want, the one you can't have
The girl that you call that doesn't ever call back
Just look at me
I've got everything

But then I woke up
I like living in dream
It's everything it's supposed to be
Listen to me scream
It's a holiday from me
It's all just kickin in
And this is where I begin
Just being me
But it's okay to be me

But it's fun to be a a hip hop queen
A rock and roll dream
It's all bling bling
Yeah baby ka-ching
Come check me out
I'm bringin down the house
I'm the one that you want and now I'm heaven sent
I'm a little Lynyrd Skynyrd
And a little 50 Cent
Just look at me
I had everything

But then I woke up
I woke up
I woke up
