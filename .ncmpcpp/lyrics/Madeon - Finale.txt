Brace yourself, brace yourself

Your last chance
Last summer
Your last dance
Beat to your own drummer

Go out fighting
Go out young
A flash of lightning
Eclipse the sun

Last chance (Brace yourself)
Last summer
Your last dance
Beat to your own drummer

Go out fighting
Go out young
A flash of lightning
Eclipse the sun

Brace yourself, brace yourself
Brace yourself, brace yourself

(Brace yourself)

For the grand finale

Your last chance
Last summer
Your last dance
Beat to your own drummer

Go out fighting
Go out young
A flash of lightning
Eclipse the sun

Brace yourself

Brace yourself
