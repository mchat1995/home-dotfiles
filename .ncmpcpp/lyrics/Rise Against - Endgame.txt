And on that day they'll tell you 
That life hummed on with no clue 
The warning signs were all 
Dismissed or shouted down 
So it goes 
The kings all failed to tell us 
The madmen failed to sell us 
On what would then befall 
The only life we know?

Were they burning signal fires 
To guide us to the fields? 
Or building funeral pyres? 
The outcome of a final appeal

The city lines are down 
The Kerosene's run out 
The fracturing of all we relied upon

Let's shed this unclean skin 
And start to feel again 
Cause all the shoulders 
On which to cry are gone

The paranoia gripped us 
The rain turned engines to rust 
The panic set in like a cancer to our hearts 
Spreading through 
We bet on finite genius 
Or prayed for gods to save us 
But there was no antidote 
Disease tore us apart

We left bodies in the fields 
So numb that we forgot how to feel

The city lines are down 
The Kerosene's run out 
The fracturing of all we relied upon

Let's shed this unclean skin 
And start to feel again 
Cause all the shoulders 
On which to cry are gone

He looked at the fields 
And then his hands 
"All I need is what I have" 
Then fell a tear of happiness

She watched the world 
Crumble away 
"Is this the end of yesterday?" 
"Lord, I hope so", is all he said

Gone are the old guards 
Gone are the cold, cold wars 
Weightless we go forth 
On wings of amnesty

All we relied on now

The city lines are down 
The Kerosene's run out 
The fracturing of all we replied upon

Let's shed this unclean skin 
And start to feel again 
With no more shoulders
Shoulders to cry on now

No more
No more

The weight that we once felt is gone
