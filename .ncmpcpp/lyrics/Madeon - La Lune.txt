Sometimes these memories pull us under
We get lost talking, days gone by
But we're not getting any younger
And now it feels like real life has dragged us in its tide

So we stay awake like we always do
And we try to recreate
And though nothing's changed and I'm next to you
It doesn't feel the same

I would never change what our past is
Written in our bones, it's who we are
I just can't control where my mind goes
When it goes too far

So we stay awake like we always do
And we try to recreate
And though nothing's changed and I'm next to you
It doesn't feel the same

Doesn't matter if we change
Doesn't matter at all
Don't you worry about me, friend
Don't you worry at all
Doesn't matter if we change
Doesn't matter at all
Don't you worry about me, friend
Don't you worry if it doesn't feel the same

It doesn't feel the same
It doesn't feel the same
(It doesn't feel the same)
(Feel the same)
(Feel the same)
