Take it all
I never needed any more
Than days on days and gentle nights
When nothing could stop me
Keep it safe
Taking secrets to the grave
When I was the king just for that one day
When nothing could stop me

Feed my soul
Force a smile, ignore the hole
Wishing like hell that I was still god
With nothing above me
Read my eye
Weary lines
Taking what's mine
Just soil below and nothing above me

Feed my soul
Marigold
I'd rather starve
Than choke what's killing me down...

Give me heresy
We were never told the truth...
The world that spoke, calm these hands
Before they can reach your throat
Give me eyes to see
Her never growing old
Good news!
They hope you choke!
Take heart
It's all fool's gold...

Leave me there
Pockets full of empty air
Paying my penance, curse this prayer
Regret never touched me
She will stay, dressed in choices that I made
Head like a king, but crown like a gravestone
Don't touch me

Feed my soul
Marigold
I'd rather starve
Than choke what's killing me down...

Give me heresy
We were never told the truth...
The world that spoke, calm these hands
Before they can reach your throat
Give me eyes to see
Her never growing old
Good news!
They hope you choke!
Take heart
It's all fool's gold...

With these hands, I could change the world
More than gold, more that I deserve
With these hands, I could change the world

I am a wealthy man, I am loved
Tell me hope's not lost
Soon you'll see I can't take it with me
When to nothing I fade
Gone, borne by the choices I made

Wake up, wake up
And soon you'll see that all hope is not lost
Not gone
