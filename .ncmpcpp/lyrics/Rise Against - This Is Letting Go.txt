Once upon a time I could take anything, anything.
I always stepped in time, regardless of the beat
I moved my feet, I carried weight
What I could not do I faked
I dug seeking treasure
Just to wake up in an early grave
I stopped right then and said

Go on alone
Because I won't follow
But this isn't giving up
No, this is letting go

Out with the old
Dreams I've borrowed
The path I carve from here on out will be my own
This path will be my own

This is the part where the needle skips and the chorus plays
Like a sink that drips
A syllable repeating
Like a warning we aren't heeding until all of
A sudden we notice it
When the wheels brace and the tires grip
A map we've been misreading
A defeat we're not conceding until now
There must be some other way out

Go on alone
Because I won't follow
But this isn't giving up
No, this is letting go

Out with the old
Dreams I've borrowed
The path I carve from here on out will be my own
The path to take me home

The wind died
The whole world ceased to move
Now so quiet
Her beating heart became a boom
We locked eyes
For just a moment or two
She asked why
I said, "I don't know why"

Go on alone
Because I won't follow
This isn't giving up
No, this is letting go

I made the most
Of all this sorrow
I tried to brave this
Discontent but now I'm through
I'm letting go of you
