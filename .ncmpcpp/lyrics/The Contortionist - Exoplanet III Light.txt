The microcosm is in exhibition.
Terrestrial shaped into a magnificent realm.
Our colonial settlements are threatened by the sky.
The circling disk of ice watches quietly from a distance.
Refracting nebulaic dust has pierced the outer shell.
A blooming world is being ripped apart.
Planetary wide scorching from the focused light.
This extra solar vessel, orbiting the cluster.
Ejects the sample pods of the Eden Passengers.
As for us, we must migrate.
This exoplanet has failed.
