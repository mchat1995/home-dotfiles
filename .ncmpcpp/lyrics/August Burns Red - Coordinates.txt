Let go of all that you perceive
Everything's not as it seems
Let go of all that you perceive
Everything's not as it seems

See today for what it is
Not what it can give
Make your way. You're lost within
That's no way to live

Good we've given. Bad we've committed
We believe we're all forgiven

The mark of the man is not where he stands
Where he stands, where he stands when all is right in the world
It's what he does when the chilling wind
The chilling wind, chilling wind threatens to break down his door

Inhale the bravery
Exhale, exhale the worry

His life's on the edge but his soul survives
His sanity is stolen but he's civil inside
They hold his feet to the fire
Hoping he'll be inspired

The rocks at the bottom will know your name

Don't let shame replace who you'll be with who you are
Contempt is a weak metal for building anything of wonder
Ask a man on his deathbed what he truly believes
He will say it's not the trophies or the places he's seen

The unanswered questions leave the greatest impression

Let go of all that you perceive
Everything's not what it seems
