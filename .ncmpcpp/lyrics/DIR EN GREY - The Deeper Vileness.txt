I have fun listening to your lies...
I shout out joy and you shout for help
Fuck! I hate you!
Dear God, You're a MOTHERFUCKER
Death for All - Death for All
I'm your worst nightmare,
Fuck off! I wanna die!

I don't even think of you as my friend
I don't even think of you as my friend

You deceived me and sold me out
Take off that mask of rectitude!
Pretender that hurts one's eyes, voice that jars on one's ear

Fuck 'em all without a care
Fake rock wannabes... just die

I don't even think of you as my friend
I don't even think of you as my friend

The maze, it's so cold
I'll die in a world of lies and deceits

By tomorrow I'll be in despair
It was destined

I have fun listening to your lies...
I shout out joy and you shout for help
Fuck! I hate you!
Dear God, You're a MOTHERFUCKER
Death for All - Death for All
I'm your worst nightmare,
Fuck off! I wanna die!

I don't even think of you as my friend
I don't even think of you as my friend

The maze, it's so cold
I'll die in a world of lies and deceits
I'll die in a world of lies and deceits
