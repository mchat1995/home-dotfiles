I'mma say this and I'mma end mine
If you ain't down for the Africans here in the United States, period point blank
If you ain't down for the ones that suffer in South Africa from apartheid and shit
Devil you need to step your punk ass to the side and let us brothers and us Africans step in and start puttin' some funk in that ass

Break 'em off somethin', break 'em off somethin'
Break 'em off somethin', break 'em off somethin'
Break 'em off somethin', break 'em off somethin'
Break 'em off somethin', break 'em off somethin'

Snoop Dogg:
I got my finger on the trigger so niggas wonder why
But livin' in the city it's do-or-die
I got my finger on the trigger so niggas wonder why
But livin' in the city it's do-or-die

Daz Dillinger:
Them wonder why me violent and no really understand
For the reason why me take me law in me own hand
Me not out for peace and me not Rodney King
The gun goes click, me gun goes bang
Them riot in Compton and them riot in Long Beach
Them riot in LA 'cause them no really wanna see
Niggas start to loot and police start to shoot
Lock us down at seven o'clock, barricades us like Beirut
Me don't show no love 'cause it's us against them
Them never ever love me 'cause it's sport to break them
And kill, at my own risk, if I may
To lay, to spray, with my AK, and put it to rest

Yes we have
There have been riots, ah uh, rioting
Well I don't wanna say rioting, but there's been looting downtown
But right now Bree, what I want to show you is, they have started fires down at the end of the street

Dr. Dre, Snoop Dogg, and KRS-One:
How many niggas are ready to loot?
(Yeah, so what you wanna do?) What you wanna do?
I said how many niggas are ready to loot?
(Got myself an Uzi and my brother a nine)

What they told us today, in other words, you're still a slave
No matter how much money you got, you still ain't shit

Dr. Dre and Daz Dillinger:
Sitting in my living room, calm and collected
Feeling that gotta-get-mine perspective
'Cause what I just heard, broke me in half
And half the niggas I know, plus the niggas on the Row is bailing
Laugh now but cry much later
You see when niggas get together, they get mad 'cause they can't fade us
Like my niggas from South Central, Los Angeles
They found that they couldn't handle us
Bloods, Crips on the same squad
With the ese's help and, nigga it's time to rob and mob
(And break the white man off something lovely
I don't love them so them can't love me)
Yo, straight puttin' it down, gettin' my scoot on
It's jumping off in Compton so I gots to get my loot on
And come up on me some furniture or somethin'
Got a VCR in the back of my car
That I ganked from the Slauson Swap Meet
And motherfuckers better not try to stop me
'Cause they will see that I can't be stopped
'Cause I'mma cock my glock and pop till they all drop

(There has been videotape and you can see of the, ah, some of the crowd throwing things at the officers)
And swinging at them as well
Like there was a young woman there
You see she took a swing at an officer with some object in her hand

Dr. Dre, Snoop Dogg, and KRS-One:
How many niggas are ready to loot?
(Yeah, so what you wanna do?) What you wanna do?
I said how many niggas are ready to loot?
(Got myself an Uzi and my brother a nine)

RBX:
I got my finger on the trigger so niggas wonder why
But livin' in the city it's do-or-die
I got my finger on the trigger so niggas wonder why
But livin' in the city it's do-or-die

One-time trigger happy, no nigga love
One-eighty-seven time, time to grab the glove
Can't get prints on a nine I throw away
Or get prints on my Uzi when it spray
Pop, pop, pop, another motherfucker drop
And I get relief like, plop, plop, fizz
Smash, I crashed his head like a window
I ain't Nintendo, I'm high off the indo
Creepin', with the quickness to the cut
Bust one to his head while he munches on a donut
And crack-up, so now he best to back up
I guess I gots to pack up, filling the clip up
I zip up-town but motherfuckin' cops are all around
Helicopters flyin', these motherfuckers tryin'
To catch me and stretch me on Death Row
But hell no, suppose black refuse to go

This is now covering a very, very wide area of Los Angeles where these fires have been, ah, ignited
I mean, from here to the, ah, to the south end of South Central is a long way

Break 'em off somethin', break 'em off somethin'
Break 'em off somethin', break 'em off somethin'
Break 'em off somethin', break 'em off somethin'
Break 'em off somethin', break 'em off somethin'

Daz Dillinger:
The outcome of this is destruction so them all fall
Niggas don't give a fuck, so them bust and them fall
The description of three blacks
Shows no justice, so, pick up it's your right
If you riot again, me turn the other cheek
We be too many, me got me nine to my side
So me bust, flick, 'cause he don't give a fuck and me don't give a fuck
And all my problems end with that buck, buck

Snoop Dogg:
Blam, blam, blam to till them fall
Listen to the shots from my nigga Doggy Dogg, biddy-bye
Dr. Dre, him bust gunshots
Diggidy Daz and RBX them bust gunshots, come again
