When the Army tried to drive the Sioux, from their ancestrial land,
They joined up with the Cheyenne tribe, and they made a valiant stand.
Led by Sitting Bull, they made history,
Oh, no, George didn't know there, were too many

George Custer attended West Point; he was last in his class.
He was court-martialed but the Civil War saved his ass.
Led the cavalry. Victory over Lee
He helped the U.S defeat the Condederacy.

Out in the Northern Plains, Custer was wearing blue
He advanced his forces too quickly and was trapped by the Sioux
Here was Custer's Last Stand, near Little Big Horn
Surrounded in Montana, where all of his troops were murdered.

It's the same tale by historians; over 9,000 Sioux.
That they were outnumbered should be apparent to you.
Tactical blunder, it makes one wonder,
What the hell was George thinking? What was he thinking?

The government wanted sone land that was called the Black Hills;
Breaking Indian treaties should give everyone the chills,
Let's take all the land, the chain of command.
Wo, oh, what we want to know, why did those men go?

Here was Custer's Last Stand, where he met his fate,
His remains were taken back, to West Point cemetery.

Here was Custer's Last Stand, where he met his fate
Surrounded in Montana, where all of his troops were murdered.
What the hell was George thinking? What was he thinking?
