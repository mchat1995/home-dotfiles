And the sky opened up and it swallowed us whole 
All that's left is time and healing underground 
Underneath us the cosmic dawn of war begins 
We resolve and watch as it all crumbles down

Beauty fades 
Death decays 
Fires on high 
Reach the sky 
Branches break 
Roots remain 
Strong in mind, beauty

Your adventure is dark and hides beyond the cells 
All I feel alive, the hearts will prevail 
The stolen eye was found and given to the lost soul 
While the moon sets far and milestones seem low

Beauty fades 
Death decays 
Fires on high 
Reach the sky 
Branches break 
Roots remain 
Strong in mind, beauty

And all that I have come to lose
Gone so long it doesn't matter anyway 
And all that I have come to gain 
Will remain with me until the bitter end 
And when you sit and picture me 
Remember sitting in the sun and dancing in the rain 
The end is not the end you see 
It's just the recognition of a memory

The eyes 
The face 
The lips 
The tongue 
The head 
The end
