Your thoughts are ours to manipulate.
Your actions are ours to control.
Your opinions are a thing of the past,
So tilt your head back and swallow this.
You've become a real team player, a real class act.
No one cares about your identity. Open wide, here it comes.
This prescription makes you perfect.
