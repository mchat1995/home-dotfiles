Morning star
Phosphoros
How thou shinest in the fiery empyrean above
Paracletus
How do I rejoice, for thy apostles flock around
For thou art Christ a rebours!
L'enfer abides deep within
Limbo is stirring up thy cells
Below sheol, where odium dwells

Reverse Davidian psalm
The jaws ov Hades set ajar

Let the cold moon lick the blood from my stigmatas
Let the burning sun devour gore from my wounds
For I am Christ a rebours!
L'enfer abides deep within
Limbo is stirring up my cells
Deep down below my odium dwells

Reverse Davidian psalm
The jaws ov Pandemonium set ajar

I am he who lives, and was dead
And behold, I am alive forevermore
I am he who lives, and was dead
And behold, I am alive forevermore
