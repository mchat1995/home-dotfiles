You're the one that's lost now
You shallow shit with that sad little look on your face
Why don't you just grow yourself some wings of pity

Lose track of where you are, all dolled up as a star...? You make me laugh
Money? Fame? Success?

Suck me
Destroy

Suck me
Even when you talk big, you do it by protecting yourself
Suck me
