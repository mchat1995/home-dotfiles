Yeah we can move into this groove
So just move
Let's show it to the world

So respect to disrespect the world
Come join the hell on earth we own

This is the way we are
This is the way we die
We'll show them what we've got
Let go of what we're not
We represent the dark
The sun will never rise again

"'Cause we don't need no water
Let the motherfucker burn"
These walls, they'll conceal your soul until you lose control
Regret's your shadow everywhere that you go
The quest to embark's consumed by the dark
A path yet unknown to the frail and the weak

Yeah we can move into this groove
So just move
Let's show it to the world
We're not afraid

This is the way we are
This is the way we die
We'll show them what we've got
Let go of what we're not
We represent the dark
We'll show them what we've got
Let go of what we're not

We've got the fire and let it burn
No matter how many times we fall
Like a phoenix we'll rise from the ashes

Yeah we can move into this groove
So just move
Let's show it to the world
We're not afraid

This is the way we are
This is the way we die
We'll show them what we've got
Let go of what we're not
We represent the dark
We'll show them what we've got
Let go of what we're not

No matter how many times we fall
Like a phoenix we'll rise from the ashes
Over and over
Again and again

This is the way we are
This is the way we die
