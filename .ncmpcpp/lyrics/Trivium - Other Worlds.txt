We're dreaming in color
Believing no other, no other
We're dreaming in color
Believing no other, no other

Is there hope to break through
All the walls built around you?
You're like a song within a nightmare
A thought within a scream

Dim the world, a glassy stare
Face to face now, do you even care
To try to understand
Where we went wrong or how it seems?

We're dreaming in color
Believing no other
'Cause we're living in other worlds
Breathing in other worlds

We're dreaming in color
Believing no other
'Cause we're living in other worlds
Breathing in other worlds

Broken mast, shipwrecked mind
Future sinks by design
You're like a song within a nightmare
A thought within a scream

Lost our minds, lost our way
Face to face now, do you even care
To try to understand
Where we went wrong or how it seems?

We're dreaming in color
Believing no other
'Cause we're living in other worlds
Breathing in other worlds

We're dreaming in color
Believing no other
'Cause we're living in other worlds
Breathing in other worlds

Someone wake me from this nightmare
I can't even tell what's real
Someone wake me from this nightmare
I can't even tell what's real

We're dreaming in color
But we're living in other worlds
Breathing in other worlds

We're dreaming in color
But we're living in other worlds
We lost our way in the other worlds

We're dreaming in color
Believing no other
'Cause we're living in other worlds
Breathing in other worlds

We're dreaming in color
Believing no other
'Cause we're living in other worlds
Breathing in other worlds
