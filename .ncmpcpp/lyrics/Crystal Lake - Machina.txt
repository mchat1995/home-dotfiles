Subconsciously creating machines
Unknowingly providing vaccines
This is our fuel to become the divine
Savor your sins 'cause you're out of time

We are the cure
For your salvation
It's all practical
Breathe in our fear
We are your fear

To redesign
Inside your mind
And break it down to keep us alive

You were abandoned by the creators
Add so we're here
We're by the closest to god that you can ever be near
