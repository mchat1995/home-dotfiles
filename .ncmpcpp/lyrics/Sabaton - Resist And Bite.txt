War is coming swiftly
The border is closing in
We're a company of soldiers
We're 40 rifles strong

All alone
Stand alone

Ardenner Ground is burning
And Rommel is at hand
As the Blitzkrieg's pushing harder
The war is all around

All around
Hold your ground

Fight for 18 days of battles
No odds are on our side
Few will fight for all
Until the bullets are gone

We! We will resist and bite
Bite hard, 'cause we are all in sight
We! We take up arms and fight
Fight hard, resist and do what's right

No matter our fighting
Their numbers will still count
We're outgunned and few in numbers
We're doomed to flag and fail

We fought hard
Held our guard

But when captured by the Axis
And forced to tell the truth
We will tell it with a smile
We will surprise them with a laugh

We are all
We were all

We were told to hold the border
And that is what we did
Honored by our orders
In despite of our foe

We! We will resist and bite
Bite hard, 'cause we are all in sight
We! We take up arms and fight
Fight hard, resist and do what's right

Gloria fortis miles
The Wehrmacht closing in
Adversor et admorsus
The boar against the eagle
Gloria fortis miles
The Wehrmacht closing in
Adversor et admorsus
The boar against the eagle

We! We will resist and bite
Bite hard, 'cause we are all in sight
We! We take up arms and fight
Fight hard, resist and do what's right
