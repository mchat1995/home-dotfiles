It's always better on the other side of it
Wanting what you never have
It's a goddamn broken state of mind that we've been living in

It's never greener inside the mess we're in
Wanting what you never have
The less we are content the more we throw away what little time we have left to grow

Separate mind from me, but still I have no adamant will to leave
What little time we have

Stop bleeding on the inside
We are alive, and it's more than enough to paint the walls that are white
Can we show the ones who are blind?

It's envy eating away at the core of us
Wanting what you never have
Isn't it the point of living to breathe
Knowing this is all we need

It's never greener inside the mess we're in
Wanting what you never have
The less we are content the more we throw away what little time we have left to grow

Separate mind from me, but still I have no adamant will to leave
What little time we have

Stop bleeding on the inside
We are alive, and it's more than enough to paint the walls that are white
Can we show the ones who are blind?
Show them that we're not blind!
We're not blind!

Stop bleeding on the inside
We are alive, and it's more than enough to paint the walls that are white
Can we show the ones who are blind?

Fly passed the withered trees
Ascend to holy air and breathe
(Separating)
(Drive me crazy)
(Separating mind)

This want is menacing and will not leave us be
Can we purge this?
The bastard in our brain will chew until it bleeds

How did we get like this?
Step out in the rain
Feel life in our veins
