Down
It was his neck or her wrist
Clean nails on iron fist
Dreams of peace beyond the wall
She'd cry out for mercy but she had no voice at all

Here
Here and now it ends
This quiet victory
Her promise she would make amends
He lay not yet cold on the ground
This day of all days she would wear her dark hair down

This time the wheel has come around
Free of her cage she crows with a fearless sound
"Your fists can't hurt me now"
A fearless sound
She'll wear her dark hair down

Down
And blood brought the answer that time could not provide
Scars that read like home could hide
Her prison swallowed everything but piercing open eyes
She proudly bore the mark
Where his brand had met her head
She spat "The coward could not kill what was already dead."

Dark hair down
This time the wheel has come around
Free of her cage
A fearless sound

Stand and fight
This is my salvation
Blood for blood my love

With a fearless sound
"Your fists can't hurt me now"
A fearless sound
She'll wear her dark hair down

Blood for blood my love
