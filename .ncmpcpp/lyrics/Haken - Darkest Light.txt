Take away my vision
Shine your darkest light into my eyes

I'm blind to your obsession
You hide your weakness behind cold confession
"Forgive me father for I have sinned"
Just take a look at the mess your faith has put you in

I can feel no guilt when the eye of the storm
Is blind to what is wrong inside my mind

You're cold and I'm corroding
So blind to my weakness for someone all-knowing
How can I believe when I've not seen?
Just take a look at the mess my faith has put me in

Still I feel no guilt when the eye of the storm
Is blind to what is wrong inside my mind
I once believed indefinitely when I could forgive myself

Take away my wisdom
Place your darkest light into me
Take away my vision
Shine your darkest light into my eyes

The day that I awaken
I'd trade a lifetime of weakness for a moment of clarity
Blindsighted I've been, now I can see
So take a look just what your faith has done to me

Now I feel the guilt when the eye of the storm
Is wise to what I've done inside my mind
I will believe indefinitely but I can't forgive myself

Take away my vision
Take away my wisdom

Take away my vision
Take away my wisdom
