At dawn's first light
Run for your lives

Viking ships come out of the mist
Ominous sight
Flee or stand fast
You won't last

Warlords invade with axe and blade
Attack at first light
Unstoppable force
No remorse

Under attack, no turning back
You cannot run
Nowhere to hide
No shelter inside

Under attack, no turning back
Slaughter's begun
Nowhere to hid
No shelter inside

Slashing, killing
Thrashing, spilling
Blood for honor, death, and glory!

Out of the night
At dawn's first light
Longships arrive
Run for your lives!

Wounds won't mend your bitter end
Death to all
Flee or fight
No one survives

Bloodshed won't stop
'Til the last drop
You will fall
It matters not how hard you fought

Under attack, no turning back
You cannot run
Nowhere to hide
No shelter inside

Under attack, no turning back
Slaughter's begun
Nowhere to hid
No shelter inside

Slashing, killing
Thrashing, spilling
Blood for honor, death, and glory!

The ships bring terror to these shores
Death and all out war
Their oars are cutting through the waves
Like spades are digging graves

At dawn's first light
Run for your lives

Out of the night
At dawn's first light
Longships arrive
Run for your lives!
