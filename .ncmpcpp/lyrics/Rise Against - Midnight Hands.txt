Like a new day rising
Like a calm before the storm
Like fog lifting from valleys
On a sleeping forest floor
Eyes open slowly as the dust is shaking off
To gaze upon the wreckage 
That the midnight hands have wrought

And now I
I feel my temperature rising
My body explode
I feel like somebody's watching
Like I'm not alone
I stop dying but right there and say that

Whatever path you take (the path you take)
Wherever you may go (where you may go)
Wherever you decide to leave
I'll follow
I'll fall

We face a crossroad never knowing what's in store
There's an angel on my shoulder
There's a devil at my door
She proclaimed that tonight
Will be the greatest of our lives
And I said, don't be so short
Let's just wait until the morning light

I feel my temperature rising
My body explode
I feel like somebody's watching
Like I'm not alone
I stop dying but right there and say that

Whatever path you take (the path you take)
Wherever you may go (where you may go)
Wherever you decide to leave
I'll follow
I'll fall

There in the clearing
We gather close
Under the moon's pale light
We lay out the tools
You don't have to do this
But I forgive you if you don't
She just looked away
And said "I know"

Gripping the midnight hands
We drain the futures
They might prevent
Gripping the midnight hands

The lines cross over
The dawn grows closer
In spite of too much
It's just with a blind trust
In order of our blind faith

Whatever path you take
And wherever you might go
And whenever you decide to leave
I'll follow
I'll fall

I'll bear all the falls you take (the falls you take)
I will let go if you decide to stay
I'll be there until you go away from here
I'll follow
I will follow
I will follow

Whatever path you take (I will follow)
Wherever you might go (I will follow)
Wherever you decide to leave (I will follow)
