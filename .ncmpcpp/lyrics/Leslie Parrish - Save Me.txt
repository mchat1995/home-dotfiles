I'm all alone
Keep on trying to think what was so wrong
Keep on trying to analyze my love
Deep in my heart I can't cry and going on

Once in a life
You can meet a boy and feel him right
You can meet a boy that gives you a light
Once in a life he can makes you feeling fine

With you and me together
I can't say goodbye to you, you were my world
Baby you killed me in a moment with a knife and a rose in your smile
Please

'Cause baby I can't survive
You got to keep me alive
So baby save me

To keep my faith and be strong
Now we can try again to get along
'Cause baby I can't survive
