Warn your warmth to turn away
Here it's December every day
Press your lips to the sculptures and surely you'll stay
Love like winter, for of sugar and ice I am made, I am made

It's in the blood, it's in the blood
I met my love before I was born
He wanted love, I taste of blood
He bit my lip and drank my warmth from years before

She exhales vanilla lace
I barely dreamt her yesterday, yesterday
Read the lines in the mirror through the lipstick trace
Por siempre, she said "it seems you're somewhere far away" to his face

It's in the blood, it's in the blood
I met my love before I was born
She wanted love, I taste of blood
She bit my lip and drank my warmth from years before

Love like winter

It's in the blood, it's in the blood
I met my love before I was born
He wanted love, I taste of blood
He bit my lip and drank my warmth from years before
