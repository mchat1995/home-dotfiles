I'm never gonna understand this
I'm never gonna let it be
I just can't understand this aged plan
It's obsolete
How could you recognize
And cherish hysteric fairy tales?
They've come to life
Now sit by and listen, the whole world wails

I feel as though I've been abducted
Or maybe I am just misplaced
As I watch these rash hysterics
Lay to waste the human race
Just ask them if the sky will
Open and save us from the truth
They say that they'd leave today
Just without, without you

Is this one big joke?
I can only hope
Say your prayers
They're the final punch line
I don't see the love
Below or above
I see you're scared
Well, I feel fine

Oh, please, believe (oh, please, believe)
I'm doing just fine
For what's deceased I shall never grieve
Just let your faith die

Die

I feel I've been abandoned
Do I alone see disgrace?
As I watch these mad dogmatics
Govern our entire race
Don't tell them you can walk on water
Or they may drink your blood
Why live for pain in the name
The name of, name of love?

I can only hope
This is in one big joke
Say your prayers as the final punch line

How is it divine
When it's flawed design?
Fill the cracks with
Faith I can't find

Oh, please believe (oh please believe)
I'm doing just fine
For what's deceased I will never grieve
Just let your faith die

Screaming for pure love
You venerate
Delusion based in hate
Bleeding from pure love
For this I pray
We've got to shake the faith

Shake the faith
Oh, please

Oh, please, believe (oh, please, believe)
I'm doing just fine
For what's deceased I shall never grieve
Just let your faith die
Oh, please, believe
I'm doing just fine
For what's deceased I shall never grieve
Just let your faith die

Die
