Here's the elite squad, the special command
Secret assassins, a few chosen men
Heaven may cry, heed the call
Ready to die, it's the thrill of the race
Guardians when terror is showing its face
You can try, you can hide, it's suicide
You're all going down

Fight fire with fire; attack by surprise
They live though they're destined to die

They're always the first to fight
This is unconventional warfare step out of the light
Heroes of our time
They're always the first to fight
They're always the first to fight
This is unconventional warfare step out of the light
Heroes of our time
They're always the first to fight

A flirt with the danger, a life on the edge
The soldiers of anger; to serve and protect
A force always ready to strike
Hunting the monsters walking this earth
All lost in this chaos, we pray for rebirth
Shall this war end all wars
Or is this just the way of the world

Come killer angels; head for the light
Prepare for the venomous bite

Here's The elite squad the special command
Secret assassins, a few chosen men
A force always ready to strike

Fight fire with fire; attack by surprise
Prepare for the venomous bite
