When you pull me in sometimes I almost feel
The picture in my head is just too real
It's gonna be how it is, there's some things you don't change
I'm done with telling myself that story

How slowly we built the walls
Years they pile up
I will steal you back
Funny how the smallest lie
Might live a million times
I will steal you back

Here we go, here we go, we'll take on so much pain
To feel secure, not feel anything
I only pick a fight I'm sure to lose
So how can I not hold my hope for you

How slowly we built the walls
Years they pile up
I will steal you back
Funny how the smallest lie
Might live a million times
I will steal you back

(Back, back)

How slowly we built the walls
Years they pile up
I will steal you back
Funny how the smallest lie
Might live a million times
I will steal you back

(Back, back)
I will steal you back
I will steal you back
