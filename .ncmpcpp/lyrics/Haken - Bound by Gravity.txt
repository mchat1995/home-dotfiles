Bless us with the gift of a morning
That lightens the day
Infecting us with hope
Like a flower that rose from the grave
There will be a shift in perspective
But nothing can change
Until the floodgates and the doors of perception
Have swung open wide

The stars align
Vermillion dawn
Gravity's bind
Embraces all

An ethereal force keeps the beat in all our hearts
And our feet on the ground
(Is this the life our days and nights will be undone?)

Here we are collating our thoughts
In a gathering of clouds
(If this is life will space and time bleed into one?)
If we dictate the cause and face no consequences
Would our worlds still intertwine?
(If this is love hearts beat as one and never stop)
Stop the clocks before they grow impatient
And conscious of time

In a dying sun
All will be undone
So our time has come
We are reborn as one

The stars align
Vermillion dawn
Gravity's bind
Embraces all

When the stars align
Within your bind
Our worlds will intertwine
All is love
Our souls collide
A swarm of minds reborn
Then we find euphoria

The storm subsides
Your will is done
A swarm of minds
Reborn as one
