Liturgies and prophecies
They mean nothing to me
I believe in substance
Not the pattern that you see

Life burns me alive
Life burns me alive

Straws you grip so tightly
Now becoming your own noose
Story collapsing, ask yourself
Can you hang from your own truth?

Life burns me alive
Life burns me alive

Sever the hand of any god or man
Sever the hand to free yourself again, free yourself again
Sever the hand of any god or man (Of any god or man)
Sever the hand to free yourself again, free yourself again

Go

Mindlessly crawling, you're choked by a leash
Seeking redemption, you practice and preach
Cognitive failure, your sickness reveals
The horror and panic, exposing what's real

Life burns me alive
Life burns me alive

Sever the hand of any god or man
Sever the hand to free yourself again, free yourself again
Sever the hand of any god or man (Of any god or man)
Sever the hand to free yourself again, free yourself again
