Yeah

Wounded and tired and worried
It's like fighting an invisible enemy
Wounded and tired and worried
What lies ahead you thought you'd never see

No one wants to end up in the clouds
You can't lose a battle you could never win
You can't finish a fight without the strength within

Beliefs set aside, the uncertainty is what's truly terrifying

Be scared or be brave
Where we end is all the same
Be scared or be brave
Memories are everything
Be scared or be brave
Reminiscing is for the living
Be scared or be brave
Memories are everything
Be scared or be brave
Reminiscing is for the living

Pain is setting in
It's surrounding us, it's surrounding us
Pain is setting in
It's surrounding us

Pain is surrounding, surrounding us

Your quiet heart makes us sink further
We will accept our biggest fear
We're sinking further
We're sinking further
Escape into thin air
Escape into thin air
You'll find relief in being lost
In being lost
