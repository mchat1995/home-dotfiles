Breathe in, breathe out
Before you start to drown
Breathing in, breathing out
I've made my deathbed along the evil you are

The evil you are

Swallowed into the darkness beyond
No shred of silence coming out
Only my hatred remains

Burning redemption of voices unheard, all in a blur
Drowned in my way but dreaming dismay

We lie, we lie until the end
Inside we're trying to pretend
That we know we'll never know

We lie, we lie until the end
Inside we're trying to pretend
That we know we'll never know

I have seen when the nemesis finds out
Only thing ruling love must be fear
Push away, push away everything you are
Push away every living feeling you got

Breathe in, breathe out
Before you start to drown
Breathing in, breathing out
I've made my deathbed along the evil you are

The evil you are

Wearing out the best of me
Wasting breath on everything

We lie, we lie until the end
Inside we're trying to pretend
That we know we'll never know

We lie, we lie until the end
Inside we're trying to pretend
That we know we'll never know

Breathing in, breathing out
Don't wake me up now from my slumber
Breathing in, breathing out
Don't wake me up, don't wake me up

Breathing in, breathing out
Don't wake me up now from my slumber
Breathing in, breathing out
Don't wake me up, don't wake me up

Breathing in and out
Breathing in and out
Breathing in and out
Breathing in and out

Breathing in and out
