Dying to see how you beg for me
Outspoken like before, empty and heretofore
In spite of what we were
I'll outgrow what you think you are

Drowning in a broken record
Voiceless, still I bleed out my ears
Grumbling as I start to feel like
I've kept my mouth and eyes shut till I break down

My life, your life? Filled with countless choices
Every path has both grief and rejoices
Your poison harmonized with the noises in oblivion
But you undermine the work of my brilliance

Dying to see how you beg for me
Outspoken like before, empty and heretofore
In spite of what we were
I'll outgrow what you think you are

You'll never know that nothing is definite

Would you understand what makes the world go around?
You think you do, you really don't with a mind of a hypocrite
If you can't understand what I'm singing on this track
You'd shut your fucking mouth and get over it

Dying to see how you beg for me
Outspoken like before, empty and heretofore
In spite of what we were
I'll outgrow what you think you are

Dying to see how you beg for me
Outspoken like before, empty and heretofore
In spite of what we were
I'll outgrow what you think you are
