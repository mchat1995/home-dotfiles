I want to be ignorant to the frailty of my life
Days are grains of sand in a disciple's hand

Looking out my window
Through the grey and lifeless sky
I know what I am

I want to see the rain in fear through primal eyes
But I'm terrified of the silence that kept me
Before I was alive

And passing days feel shorter with every moment I leave behind
And dawn is breaking now on the minds still left to decide

I want to see the rain in fear through primal eyes

I want to be innocent of hypocrisy and lies
But in these surroundings the strongest survive

And seeing the world before me
As the end result of all that has been
I know what I am

I want to see the rain in fear through primal eyes
But I'm terrified of the silence that kept me
Before I was alive

And passing days feel shorter with every moment I leave behind
And dawn is breaking now on the minds still left to decide

I want to feel the pain of zeal behind your cries
It seems an easy way to escape from the silence

And if I look back now with regret
I know I've lost something I'll never find again

And every day I'm getting older
And the world slips further away

And every step is only closer
To the one you lost
Behind the road
Beyond our human wants and gains
To both your faith and my disdain
(Your trembling lips betray your aim)
And you know that when it ends
We end the same

And every day I'm getting older
And in our world I will decay

With every step a little closer
To my final breath
Beyond regret
Past hope and love and human pain
(And when it ends)

We end the same

And passing days feel shorter with every moment I leave behind
And dawn is breaking now on the minds still left to decide
