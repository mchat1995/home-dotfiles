Here in the world of words unspoken we've broken down
Let's take that defective heart apart
Out of the light - a final showing
We're closing down and to get that faulty heart to start

Follow me down the road
I'm promising I will be a good boy

I can't let you see, I can't let you see
I can't let you see me sleeping
I can't let you see, I may have to leave
I can't let you see me sleeping

Here in the world of words unspoken we've broken down
And to get that faulty heart to start
Enter this house of empty movements
We're losing every faint sense of who we were. We are

Follow me to this room
Promise me you will keep your eyes closed

I can't let you see, I can't let you see
I can't let you see me sleeping
I can't let you see, I may have to leave
I can't let you see me sleeping

I can't let you see me
I can't let you see me
I can't let you see me sleep
With my mouth agape
Don't watch me too closely

I can't let you see, I can't let you see
I can't let you see me sleeping
I can't let you see old blood on my teeth
I can't let you see me sleeping

I can't let you see me sleeping
I can't let you see me sleeping
