There is a mis-misunderstanding that there's a bliss beneath it all
Every time it's never ending, there is a kiss to change us all
It's in the dark, it's in your photo that keeps on falling from the wall
Tell me it's better way up there. I need you. I need you
I need you to tell me

Does it feel the same
After healing, fame
And all the strange, strange, strange behavior?
Does it make it worse?
They mispronounce the hurt
I feel so strange, I'm still a stranger

Is there the misunderstanding that there's a hit of healing light?
Tell me the cuts finally stop showing before we kiss, again, the night
Here in the dark, tripping your picture I keep rehanging on the wall
I need you better way up there. I need you. I need you better

Does it feel the same
After healing, fame
And all the strange, strange, strange behavior?
Does it make it worse?
They mispronounce the hurt
I feel so strange, I'm still a stranger

Does it feel the same?!
Would I feel like you?!
Because I still feel strange!
Are you a stranger too?! (I'm still a stranger)
I wish it mattered more! (I'm still a stranger)
But I never will be you!
I always feel so fucking strange!
Are you a stranger too?
I'm still a stranger!
I'M STILL A STRANGER! (Are you a stranger?)

Does it feel the same
After healing, fame
And all the strange, strange, strange behavior?
Does it make it worse?
They mispronounce the hurt
I feel so strange, I'm still a stranger

I'm still a stranger
I'm still a stranger
