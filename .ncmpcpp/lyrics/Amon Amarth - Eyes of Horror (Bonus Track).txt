Every night I see through eyes
Of a different lunatic
And every night I fantasize
In trancial mesmeric

All alone inside my head
Within my padded cell
Ruled by thoughts of another mind
Controlled by unseen eyes

In my mind I see the sun
Plunge into the sea I listen to my
Tales now I'll tell you what I see
And so the corpses
And the thrill
My mind is warped
Nothing's real

Do I dream
Or is it true
The piercing scream
She never knew
