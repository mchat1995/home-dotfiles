We've heard the sound that ears bleed to hear.
The sound of a place the entire universe awaits.
A passion so powerful that walls crumble to their foundations.
Here the strongest fall to their knees.
The lost find their way back home,
But the masses buy what will make them rich,
Feasting on lies, chasing their tails.
Truth be told, they'll get what they were promised.
Crawling away, burning with regret, to the deepest, darkest depths of Hell.
We got news for you.
The day is soon coming when turning your back won't be an option.
Keep telling yourself what you really don't believe.
You can compromise what you know to be true,
And you can turn off all of your senses,
But in the end you'll see nothing stands between a man and his maker.
No matter what it's your decision.
This isn't something you could do alone.
Give up, give in no matter what, it's your decision.
