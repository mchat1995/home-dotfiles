I think my cup is getting muddy, oh buddy
Is this that punch, drunk, and love it, no buggy?
Eyes bloody when we out in public, I'm hubby, she say she love me
Wasted money on syrup and honey, she think she Duffy
Then I became the druggy, enhance my fame and money
And for your pain and suffering, our time is waiting for me
Expecting pain is from me, but she won't get a damn thing from me
She just might get a band aid from me, you swear the Benz and these bands ain't from me

I know I'm a scum bag and now your heart broke
The night is still young, for you to sleep and whine
Slow, slow, slow, for you to sleep and whine
Slow, slow, slow, oh yeah
I know your heart is broken, pick up your wine glass
With your fine ass, before your wine glass
Slow, slow, just lemme see you whine
Slow, slow, oh yeah

M.I.A.
How the fuck am I supposed to live
How many fucks am I supposed to give
How the fuck am I supposed to feel
Treated like the bellboy, check and split
Tell your new bitch she can suck a dick
Tell your new bitch she can suck a dick
Tell your new bitch she can suck a dick
Tell your new bitch she can suck a dick

You the one that was putting up with me
You see how this screecher wrote to me
I got a coco everything in front of me
Go to fuck your ho after you turn on me
We with the shits on the real, I do this shit on the real
I like to drink on the real, fuck your bitch on the real
We do this shit on the real, keep it real on the real
I was just keeping it G, she don't spend money at first
Say you're in love with me, but I know it never gon' work
I come through, top back, hangin' out the verse
I screwed up, I'm drinkin' syrup
I know that look that you givin' me
This killer she's awfully into me
