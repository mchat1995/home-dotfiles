Up until the day you met the family
You'd never felt that pain begin to drain, oh!
And up until the day you sold the family
You'd kept that fractured face from being shown

Let's play
Turn to stone
Like you played with broken bones
Now finally you can see me turn to stone

Up until the day you cracked the fountain
I'd never felt my life drain in that way, oh!
Up until that day you tainted the water
You'd kept that average face from being shown

Let's play
Turn to stone
Like you played with broken bones
Now finally you can see me turn to stone

Whoa
Dumb kids
Dumb kids
Were we only playing like dumb kids?
Dumb kids
Dumb kids

Let's play
Turn to stone
Like you played with broken bones
Now finally you can see me turn to stone

Were we only playing like dumb kids?
Dumb kids
Were we only playing like dumb kids?
Dumb kids
Dumb kids
