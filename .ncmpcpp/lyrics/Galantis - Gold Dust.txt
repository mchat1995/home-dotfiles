You're like gold dust
It breaks all of me
A foreign sun that I thought I'd never see
You're like gold dust

Oh don't change ever, no don't change
There's a hollow in this house whenever you go

You're like gold dust
It breaks all of me
A foreign sun that I thought I'd never see
You're like gold dust

Keep coming down the street
There's a hollow in this house whenever you go

Keep coming down the street
There's a hollow in this house whenever you go

Keep coming down the street
There's a hollow in this house whenever you go

You're like gold dust
