Why did you touch me?
Your hand wrapped me warmly
Why did you look at me?
I can not forget the day wich met you

A quiet white place
No one knows space
Only you and I paint our heaven
We are traveling
Nobody understands in a destination

It began from the day
Our promice nobody can erase it
It is warmly lighted even
When dark cold Cloud is drifting in the blue sky
I feel air in the whole body
I want to draw recolection with you on the diary of life

Walking in the air... Where is loving place?
I beileve always forever
You beileve always forever
You are the one Find our marry stage... only you and I
Fly away from cold, silence emptyness
From white space nothing place

Cloud is drifting in the blue sky
I feel air in the whole body I want to draw recolection with you on the diary of life

Walking in the air... Where is loving place?
I beileve always forever You beileve always forever
You are the one Find our marry stage... only you and I
Fly away from cold, silence emptyness From white space nothing place
