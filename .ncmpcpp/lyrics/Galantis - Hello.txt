There's a voice in my head telling me to stay
If I take one more step, I'll never be the same
I keep running, running, running running from your love
And I keep running, running from you

Hello, can you hear me now?
This is your heart begging you, turn, turn back around
Hello, can you hear me now?
This is your heart begging you, turn, turn back around

Hello, can you hear me now?
Hello, hello

Now the door's wide open, but I'm still outside
All the words unspoken, written in my mind
I keep running, running, running running from your love
And I keep running, running from you

Hello, can you hear me now?
This is your heart begging you, turn, turn back around
Hello, can you hear me now?
This is your heart begging you, turn, turn back around

Hello (hello), hello (hello)
Hello (hello, hello, hello, hello)
Hello, can you hear me now?
Hello, hello?
