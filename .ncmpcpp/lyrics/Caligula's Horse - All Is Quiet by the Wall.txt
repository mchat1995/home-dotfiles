When the world is quiet, just a whisper breaks your rest...

Peace
Reach for the light
Like a child
Desperate grip on the passing breeze
Cling to peace
Close to your chest
There's cracks in your voice as we sing
"When the world is quiet, just a whisper breaks your rest..."

Wait
"Give me the child, I'll give you the man!" They say
No - We'll walk through fire to fight you
Asleep or awake
It's not the simple sacrifice you planned
No
I'll wait by the wall - let them come
Here I stand

Peace
Run while you can
Rising hands speaking a language we all understand
"Forget peace"
The lie didn't take - you won't break
The spirit a martyr the mind has freed
Forget peace

The stars were just beacons then
They will make amends
Colour to his eyes
Let the light pour in
We've already lost enough time to shadows
And damned ourselves to empty oaths we wear like broken glass to make us whole

I wait
"Give me the child, I'll give you the man!" They say
No - We'll walk through fire to fight you
Asleep or awake
It's not the simple sacrifice you planned
No
I'll wait by the wall - let them come
Here I stand

Here.
Out of my cage
Free
Out of this place... Finally

Hand in hand with our own
This is our home. This is our home
Let our sign say: "Let them come and meet their end"
Now the world is quiet, this is where we make our stand
