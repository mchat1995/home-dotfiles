It's necessary to stay this land no more.
Now all of matter not and corrupt.
Our hymn is gotten wet in the rain everyday.
That never reaches the sky.

Only darkness will wait for me even through
I live a life as I am.
We have our prayer stained.
Than never reaches the sky.

Destruction this reality by eternal flam.
Vanish the cursed land and
Greet our sunrise.

It's necessary to stay this land no more.
Now all of matter not and corrupt.
Our hymn is gotten wet in the rain everyday.
That never reaches the sky.

Silence of northern hell.
That is our holy land.
Silence of northern hell.
Go to the light...
