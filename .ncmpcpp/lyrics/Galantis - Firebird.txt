We started at the cinema
T-Roof dancing hands in the wind
Rizlas, rollin' up a cigarette
The boys are calling shotgun again
Hot blooded like a harlequin
Our heroine is tremblin
Shake shaken like a tambourine
Colors runnin' into our skin

And all the stars are awaken
To the sound of the firebird
Under the sky half naked
Oh oh, oh oh oh
And all the stars are awaken
To the sound of the firebird
Under the sky half naked

And all the stars are awaken
To the sound of the firebird
Under the sky half naked
