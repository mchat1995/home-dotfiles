Switch the light off
Welcome to the night
What's the problem?
Not gonna make it right
Then bite the trigger hold tight
(It's a feeling you know)

Running under lights up in the sky
Nothing matters when you're in the fight
Hold your fire
Maybe we can make it all right
(You take, take it, take it from no one)

But I don't know what to call it (call it)
When I know I don't care anymore
In the end we know it's always wrong

Cry out!
Will you tell me now
So we say we want change and never be the same
Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah
Cry out! Oh I'm burning now
Can't you hear the sound?

(Voices all around! 'Cause w're going down!)

In the moment can't move it from the start
So close, so hard to fall apart
Only heaven knows how far we are
(You take, take it take it from no one)

I know this feeling
You're the only one that's really lost
(Never gonna get it, never gonna get it)
(You take, take take take it from no one)

But I don't know what to call it (call it)
When I know I don't care anymore
In the end I know we'll all be gone

Cry out!
Will you tell me now
So we say we want change and never be the same
Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah
Cry out!
Oh I'm burning out
Can't you hear the sound?

One by one
It's taking apart
It's taking a part of me

Can't you hear the voices screaming？
Out loud to me I feel it
We can be the change we needed
Shout it out now shout it out now

Can't you hear the voices screaming？
Out loud to me I feel it
We can be the change we needed
Shout it out now shout it out now!

OH!

Cry out!
Will you tell me now
So we say we want change and never be the same yeah
Cry out!
Oh I'm burning out
Can't you hear the sound?

(Voices all around! Can't you hear the sound? 'Cause we're going down!)
(Voices all around! 'Cause we're going down!)
