Went from chicken shit ho to magnificent pro
Shoppin' bags at the grove, MCM on the coat
Had to clean up her nose, Had to dream of some goals
Swimming in Fendi business that's probably owned
I was walking down sixth, She pulled up in a 6
She said, "Hop in this whip"
I said, "Bitch, you da feds"
She said, "Baby don't trip"
Then she rolled me a spliff, showed me pics of her kids
Then she slid me some bread like

It's yours babe
'Cause I got big money
So if you need something don't be ashamed
It's yours babe
'Cause you got big lovin'
So go and spend somethin'
I said, "Okay"

All I need is good love
Hey, all a nigga need is good love
Uh huh

And now I'm swimming in milk 'n' honey
I'm swimming in milk 'n' honey
Swi-swimming in milk 'n' honey
Swimming in milk 'n' honey
I'm swimming in milk 'n' honey
Swi-swimming in milk 'n' honey
Dick in this bitch's stomach
Spending this bitch's money
I'm swimming in milk 'n' honey
I'm swimming in milk 'n' honey
Swi-swimming in milk 'n' honey
Swimming in milk 'n' honey
I'm swimming in milk 'n' honey
Swi-swimming in milk 'n' honey
Dick in this bitch's stomach
Spending this bitch's money

It's too good to be true, I ain't got nothing to do
I got keys to the coup, I just spent all this loot
She said, "Get what you want"
She said, "Live how you do
But If I catch you with other bitches your throat I'mma slit"
I said, "It's yours babe. I put your name on this dick"
But I was lyin' of course, I'm slammin' chick after chick
Soon as she gave me the Porche, I bang her right on the strip
I copped some white in the 5th and pulled up right on a bitch like

It's yours babe
'Cause I got big money
So if you need something don't be ashamed
It's yours babe
'Cause you got big lovin'
So go and spend somethin'
I said, "Okay"

All I need is good love
Hey, all a nigga need is good love
Uh huh

And now I'm swimming in milk 'n' honey
I'm swimming in milk 'n' honey
Swi-swimming in milk 'n' honey
Swimming in milk 'n' honey
I'm swimming in milk 'n' honey
Swi-swimming in milk 'n' honey
Dick in this bitch's stomach
Spending this bitch's money
I'm swimming in milk 'n' honey
I'm swimming in milk 'n' honey
Swi-swimming in milk 'n' honey
Swimming in milk 'n' honey
I'm swimming in milk 'n' honey
Swi-swimming in milk 'n' honey
Dick in this bitch's stomach
Spending this bitch's money

I got gold, I got ice
I got Polo and Nikes
I got lean, I got sprite
'Bout to spend a couple racks in one night
And muthafuckas wanna tell me take it light
Muthafuckas wanna tell me take it easy
I don't need no one's advice, Niggas all wana be me
I was riding down 6th and got stop by the pigs
They said, "Hop out the whip!"
I said, "Fuck did I do?"
They said, "Pop up the trunk!"
I'm like pop up this dick
They said, "Don't make us shoot!"
They said, "Don't make a move!"
I was high as a kite, I had Xannies and white
I looked up at the light like what the fuck is my life
They said my plates ain't legit so they opened my shit
And when they opened my shit, It was snow in the fridge
I felt dumb as a brick, I had no idea
She had stolen the whip and this bitch had warrants and shit
And this bitch pulled multiple licks and this bitch had bodies on burners
And when I called her from my cell the only message I heard was

"It's yours babe"
"I mean you gotta do what you gotta do
Don't y--, don't say a fucking word
No, you don't say shit
Now I'm gone, I'm on a plane babe
But no you wanted to spend the money
You wanted to live, you know, wanted to live large
You got new sneakers and all that
So now you deal with them bricks
Na na na na nah I can't do nothin' for you
I told you I'm on a G5, I'm gone
I'm too gone
I gotta go now
You say my fucking name you a dead man"
(I said okay)

All I need is good love
Hey, all a nigga need is good love
Uh huh
