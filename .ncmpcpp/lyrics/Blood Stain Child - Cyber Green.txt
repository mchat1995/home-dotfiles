Disparage face!
--Not ride high!--
I can't mold (my) life
I can't dive
No throwaway gush on (my) melted road

Everyday... everyday...
I stay in my room
Like a parasite in a womb
Time is going... I feel unmanned paradise
Like a paradise on the world

A nettle in ten kohls fades down by my fall
Like a parasite in a womb
Am I lost? in my voice
When the night falls
Like a paradise on the world

I feel empty in everything yeah
When the singe of smile wails
Here is just not my life for my way
Everything is fate

Hear!..you are crying out
(a) Phone call is deep inside
If your larks phone my wave
But I'm alive...

I never hate some parades
But I am...
