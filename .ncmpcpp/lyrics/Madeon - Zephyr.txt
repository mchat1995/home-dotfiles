All we've ever done
We've ever called our own
Is gone
This lonely place is all we'll ever know
Longing somewhere far from home
I'll need your hand to hold

Will we find a place
To hold us to long ago
We're on
Pick up the pace until the solace comes
Longing somewhere far from home
I'll need your hand to hold

Tell me again it's not the end
Let us pretend
