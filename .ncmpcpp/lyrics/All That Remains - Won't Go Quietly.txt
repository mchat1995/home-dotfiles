I'm not a man on a mission
But a rising anger forces me to stand
And count my voice defiant

I'm not opposed to the process
But the facts before us demonstrate
That we must stand united

Let substance bind us all
And fact enforce our words
If need then nations fall and tremble
Before free men united

I know my past I know where I came from
I won't go quietly give in to none
I know my past my voice makes me able
We'll come together we will be as one

Look at the pattern
We see our future's being sold off right before our eyes

I know my past I know where I came from
I won't go quietly give in to none
I know my past my voice makes me able
We'll come together we will be as one

I won't go quietly, give in to none

I know my past I know where I came from
I won't go quietly give in to none
I know my past my voice makes me able
We'll come together we will be as one
