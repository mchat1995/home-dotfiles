This building is barely standing on its own foundation
On its own foundation

I've collapsed its lungs, calloused its heart
And sucked the life out of this for all of Sunday to see
For all of Sunday to see
I've collapsed its lungs, calloused its heart
And sucked the life out of this for all of Sunday to see
For all of Sunday to see

I've taken the breath out of everything they believe
I've taken the breath out of everything they hold true
Everything they hold true

Preaching to the deaf and blind, no one sees my effort
Preaching to the deaf and blind, no one gets the point
No one sees my effort, no one gets the point

Welcome to my dying home
Welcome inside these crumbling walls
A meaningless handshake greets them all with smiles of false hope
Welcome to my dying home
Welcome inside these crumbling walls

Do I even care as I watch a sea of people
Dwindling into an audience of skin and bones?
An audience who doesn't have the strength to walk out
On a man who has tarnished their faith?

I've taken the breath out of everything they believe
I've taken the breath out of everything they hold true

Preaching to the deaf and blind, no one sees my effort
Preaching to the deaf and blind, no one gets the point
