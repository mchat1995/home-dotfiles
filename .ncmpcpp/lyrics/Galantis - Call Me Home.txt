I was born around, but not down that road
The sweetest sound, took me away from you

Oh-oh, I was in you, your heart was in me
We were lovers, babe, I believed
We were in love, we were in line
We were strong but we wither and die

Now you're calling me, calling me home
Pulling me out of the crowd
Calling me, calling me home
I don't mind, don't you stop
Saying it's time to come home
We don't have to hurt no more

You call me home
You call me home
You call me home
You call me home
You call me home

A beautiful rose, but it's under the aisle
You pulling a feeling, baby, I'll wait this time

Oh-oh, I was in you, your heart was in me
We were lovers, babe, I believed
We were in love, we were in line
We were strong but we wither and die

Now you're calling me, calling me home
Pulling me out of the crowd
Calling me, calling me home
I don't mind, don't you stop
Saying it's time to come home
We don't have to hurt no more

You call me home
You call me home
You call me home
You call me home
You call me home
