Stuck in the same routine
Living an empty dream
When am I gonna wake up
Thought we had it right
Now it's an endless night
Where is it gonna take us

Realizing, everything I love is slowly killing me

I know I know
We're taking off together
Even though we always crash and burn
Tonight you and I, will fall from the sky
Drag me all the way to hell
'Cause I'm never gonna let it go
I'm never gonna let it go

音もたてず崩れ落ちた
視界から消える
狂う秒針
巻き戻す
取り戻せない何かがある

Realizing, everything I love is slowly killing me

I know I know
We're taking off together
Even though we always crash and burn
Tonight you and I will fall from the sky
Drag me all the way to hell
Cause I'm never gonna let it go

I know I know
I'm never gonna let it go
I know I know
Never gonna let it go
I know I know
Drag me all the way to hell
Cause I'm never gonna let it go

Don't lie, you know everything you do is killing me

I know I know
We're taking off together
Even though we always crash and burn
Tonight you and I will fall from the sky
Drag me all the way to hell

We're taking off together
Even though we always crash and burn
Tonight you and I will fall from the sky
Drag me all the way to hell
Cause I'm never gonna let it go

I know I know
I'm never gonna let it go
I know I know
Never gonna let it go
I know I know
Drag me all the way to hell
Cause I'm never gonna let it go
