Prone to the grave, the dark side you walk
In the light of the morning we fall
Confront the brave, the rebel we stalk,
When we came - we saw - we conquered them all

Blessed when we die, confessed not a lie
In the still of the night we awake
Don't dare to cry, when fever up high
No escape - no break - your life we will take

Gone with the night
When the unholy demons of dawn
Pray
When the sunlight is dead we're reborn

We are dead until dark - when the night is calling
Dead until dark - and at midnight high
Dead until dark - and at dawn we all will die

We are dead until dark - when the Saints are crawling
Dead until dark - and the demons fly
Dead until dark - we unite the blood-red sky

Cursed by our fate, the undead crusade
For the sanctum deep under your skin
Raise up the blade, by night we invade
For the last - of times - the fight may begin

Murder bizarre, nocturnal we are
When we rise like the phantoms of dust
Sent from the dead, we long for the red
For in blood - in god - in heaven we trust

Gone with the night
When the unholy demons of dawn
Pray
When the sunlight is dead we're reborn

We are dead until dark - when the night is calling
Dead until dark - and at midnight high
Dead until dark - and at dawn we all will die

We are dead until dark - when the Saints are crawling
Dead until dark - and the demons fly
Dead until dark - we unite the blood-red sky

Dead, dead, dead until dark
Dead, dead, dead until dark
Dead, dead, dead until dark
In the night we are

Dead, dead, dead until dark
Dead, dead, dead until dark
Dead, dead, dead until dark
In the night we are

Dead until dark
Dead until dark
Dead until dark

Dead until dark
Dead until dark
Dead until dark

Dead, dead, dead until dark
