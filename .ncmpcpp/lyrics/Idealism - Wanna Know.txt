Gone away are the golden days
Just a page in my diary
So here I am, a utopian citizen
Still convinced there's no such thing as idealism

Memories they're following me like a shadow now
And I'm dreaming
And I've already suffered the fever of disbelief

I've seen your act
And I know all the facts
I'm still in love with who I wish you were
It ain't hard to see
Who you are underneath
I'm still in love with who I wish you were
And I wish you were here

I was true as the sky is blue
I couldn't soon say the same for you
So now I find denial in my eyes
I'm mesmerized by the picture that's in my mind

Tell me when I'll finally see your shallow heart
For what it is
Cause I don't want to keep on believing in illusions

[Chorus]

Sometimes I can't explain
And I'm so sorry that I can't
I'll try to concentrate
On your true identity

[Chorus]
