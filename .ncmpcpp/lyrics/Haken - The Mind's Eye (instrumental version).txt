Underneath your mask, a place for us to hide
From this penetrating pain of mortal life
The beauty of it all makes no sense to me
With restraints on my curiosity

When you are dreaming
I am wide awake
Believe when you see me
In the mind's eye I wait
While you are sleeping

Lost inside your mind
In the dead of night
Nowhere else to hide
Playing with fire is burning my reality

The shape of things to come
Are closer than they seem
Changing your design
Every time you disappear
I'm planning my escape
Through portals of your mind
Where people seem to drop like flies

I buried your past away
Failing to seize the day
Your memory is suppressed
I'm raising the dead

Lost inside your mind
In the dead of night
Nowhere else to hide
Playing with fire is burning my reality

Lost inside your mind
I am wide awake
Nowhere else to hide
In the mind's eye I wait
