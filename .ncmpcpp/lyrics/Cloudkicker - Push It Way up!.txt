Thought I'd be an effigy
All they saw were splintering bones
Now there's nothing left of me
It's been that way for far too long
Wanted to go out with a bang
'Til they came and put me away
Now I'm bouncing off the walls
It's been that way for far too long

I just wanted the sky
So I put all my pies in a high rise
Apartment in the sky
I just wanted the sky so I climbed up to make an impact
And all I achieved... Now they're cleaning the street

Thought I'd leave an imprint on more than cement
To all the people hurrying home
They didn't notice a thing
It's been that way for far too long
Thought I'd leave a legacy after me
Jumping to a different drum
Now they push my memory away
It's been that way for far too long

I just wanted the sky
So I put all my pies in a high rise
Apartment in the sky
I just wanted the sky so I climbed up to make an impact
And all I achieved... Now they're cleaning the street

I just wanted the sky
