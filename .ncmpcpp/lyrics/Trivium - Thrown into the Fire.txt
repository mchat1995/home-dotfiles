Forgive the father for they not know
My gospel of greed is all for show

I'd be thrown into the fire
If they ever learned the truth
And the congregation weeps

I'd be thrown into the fire
If they ever learned the truth
And the congregation weeps

Will you bless us with your mysterious ways?
Will you grace us with your mysterious ways?
Will you heal us with your mysterious ways?
Will you save us with your mysterious ways?

Forgive me father, lust knows no bounds
I service my needs on hallowed grounds

I'd be thrown into the fire
If they ever learned the truth
And the congregation weeps

I'd be thrown into the fire
If they ever learned the truth
And the congregation weeps

Will you bless us with your mysterious ways?
Will you grace us with your mysterious ways?
Will you heal us with your mysterious ways?
Will you save us with your mysterious ways?

Will you bless us with your mysterious ways?
Will you grace us with your mysterious ways?
Will you heal us with your mysterious ways?
Will you save us with your mysterious ways?
