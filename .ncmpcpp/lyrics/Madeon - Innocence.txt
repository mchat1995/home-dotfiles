Breathe out and breathe in
We're still forgetting
Breathe out and breathe in
We'll be forgiven

Together, we wait for space
Together, we wait for silence
And under your breath
You spoke of innocence

And I won't be the victim
And maybe you should know
That I can see the writings
So slowly letting go

I'll give up and give in
It's only a matter of time
I'll let you chase me
And maybe there's nothing to hide

All that ever was and ever is
Is nearly coming true
All you ever see and ever hear
Will all come crashing through
When you see that you're needed
You fall in the hands of innocence

And I won't be the victim
...You should know
That I can see the writings
So slowly letting go
