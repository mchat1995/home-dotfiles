I close my eyes and slip away
And long for change within the air
Hope fills my soul, I realise
 
I have the sky under my feet
Sun up above, I am complete
Joy fills my heart in Paradise
 
I sense your hand searching for mine (I am)
Falling through time
I feel your love reaching across (Transcend)
All the years we lost
 
Someone's calling me
Echoes of a childhood memory
 
Eyes open wide as I awake
I sense no change within the air
Hope leaves my soul, I paralyse
 
This world of pain and suffering
Creeps into me and once again
I mourn the loss of innocence
 
If I could run away
Back to my innocent days
 
Someone's calling me
Echoes of a childhood memory
Someone's calling me
Echoes of a childhood memory
 
Passages of time
Buried in the chaos of my mind
Chronicles of life
Concealing a truth I left behind
 
Passages of time
Buried in the chaos of my mind
Chronicles of life
Concealing a truth I can't deny
 
Moon begins to rise
Reflecting on a life once sanctified
Night begins to fall
Voices of my youth, immutable
 
Memories collide
My scattered soul is almost unified
Thoughts are in full flight
Enveloping a wisdom earned with time
 
Passages of time
Stripping back the layers of my mind
Chronicles of life
Unraveling a truth which I must find
 
Passages of time
Stripping back the layers of my mind
Chronicles of life
Unraveling a truth I kept inside
 
Snow is falling all around
What once was lost has now been found
The life I had to leave behind
Is crystallising in my mind
 
Reminiscing on the past
A bygone time that could not last
The splintered crystal of my prime
Is now a bell that will not chime
 
The crystallising thoughts of youth
They flood my mind and show me truth
My soul was free in days of yore
A white seed that for once was pure
 
The snow is falling all around
What once was lost has now been found
The life I had to leave behind
Is crystallising in my mind
 
Reminiscing on a bygone time
Splintered crystal prime a bell that will not chime
Crystallising thoughts of my faded youth
Flood my mind and bringeth waves of truth
Now the echoes of a false lullaby
Like a black seed in a bed of lies
 
Splintering the crystal a bell that will not chime
Thoughts flood my mind in truth a faded youth
(The snow is falling)
I reminisce on the past a time gone by
(New life is calling)
Splintering the crystal a bell that will not chime
I will return

Splintering the crystal a bell that will not chime

I have returned
To the springtime in the garden
Seeds are sown, flowers grow
And the child is born again
 
Filled with delight
And the laughter is contagious
As we dance, as we sing
Celebrating 'til the end
 
Joy and respite
On the faces of the children
With a smile, realise
That their love will never end
 
I have received
Affirmation of the spirit
Falling snow takes me home
And the man is whole again
 
Mind open wide as I awake
I sense a change within myself
Hope feeds my soul I realise
 
I feel the earth under my feet
Son by my side, I am complete
Pride fills my heart in Paradise
 
Hearts open wide as I awake
I sense a change within myself
Love feeds my soul I realise
 
This world of pain and suffering
Ignites in me and once again
Sparks the rebirth of innocence
 
If I could run away
I'd choose to live for today
 
Someone's calling me
Echoes of a childhood memory
 
The moon will rise
The night will fall
I hold your hand
But you let go
 
The sun will shine
The snow will thaw
All things must pass
Into the unknown
 
Escaping the past by embracing the future
Escaping the past by embracing the future
Escaping the past by embracing the future
