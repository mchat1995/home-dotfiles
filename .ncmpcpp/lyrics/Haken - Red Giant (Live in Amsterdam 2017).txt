Blood red Sun
My companion
Feel my love
Through the static
For we rust
And dismantle
Salvage us
From the ash

A trial by fire
On shoulders of giants
We're scalded and burning
Yet she keeps on turning
If doom is impending
What are we defending?

Desolate their communion
Gaia mourns her children

Everything that ends
Beckons a revival
Sustain or to descend?
Nothing's decided
When I escape myself
How much will be remembered
Of heaven and of hell
Of what it really means to be?

Desolate their communion
Gaia mourns all her children

As time decays
Ticking lives away
All that we know eroded
Dreams that we made
Gently start to break
But they'll never fade
