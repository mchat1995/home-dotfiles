This place isn't meant for people like you
Spouting ideals for your fans to consume
You're insignificant, like an ant in the midst of elephants

You're all the same
You know you won't last forever
You're all the same
A flavor of the week is how you'll be remembered
You're all the same

Pulling your so-called burdens off of your back
Throwing them overboard along the rest
Ignoring the pioneers, insulting your peers
Did it feel good to get that off your chest?

Dragging us miles and miles through the mud
Our faces battered and bruised
We'll pick ourselves up out of the hole that you dug
Reaching and clawing to pull you under

The tides will turn, and justice will be served

"Self-righteous" isn't a term saved for the religious
The tides will turn, justice will be served
While I carve you to pieces with my words
Your legend will fade

No one will remember your name
You know you won't last forever
You're all the same
A flavor of the week is how you'll be remembered
You're all the same
No one will remember your name
