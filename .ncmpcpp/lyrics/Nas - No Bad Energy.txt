I'm oblivious to you skeptics
What you hear, you ain't never hear till I repped it
Iridescent hero's essence, please clear the exits
I chase demons outdoors, force 'em to hear the message
Air 'em out
Heard some people discussin' my whereabouts
Yeah, it's been a few sightings of me, a fair amount
Never seen much, but yet I'm never in the house
Move with style, wild exciting when I do step out
Y'all been rhyming for years and Jungle made a hit
Oochie Wally idea, sold a million records
Had 'em embarrassed, signed to Colombia
Blew a check, he was laughing
While y'all in the studio bragging 'bout your past and
Thinking back on trips to Manhattan, dad was rollin'
Hotels like The Plaza, black bell hops holding rich people' bags
Tip they hats to old men coming out of cabs
Limousine, holding doors for them
We all got a job to do, go for it

No bad energy please, no bad energy
No bad energy please, no bad energy
No bad energy please, no bad energy
No bad energy please, no bad energy

To rappers who never sold crack, telling other peoples lives
Never shot anybody, but be shootin' people in they rhymes
Never robbed nobody or re-upped with coke in they ride
I'm probably who they talkin' 'bout when they writin' most of they lines
And I ain't notice it, trappin' was what was happening, with bolder clique
Around me, I'm surrounded by the most devoted clique
We saw the smokers get rowdy for all the potentness
And still ain't know how sick it was in that ocean abyss
What doesn't come out in the wash comes out in the rinse
You suckas ain't have no say-so
Whoever put you in a position to have a say-so should be questioned they self
I'm silk shirt, summer-time sunnies, sun chaser
Pretty girl tongue taster, southern girl luster, city girl love maker
The matinee watcher, the good weather on a Saturday afternoon shopper
Good gift copper, still miss Big Poppa

No bad energy please, no bad energy
No bad energy please, no bad energy
No bad energy please, no bad energy
No bad energy please, no bad energy
