It is cheesed with power and the morality of which it goes mad
A lot of people became dogs having tied to the chain
Your happy there?

I want to be enjoying the life though it will knock against a high wall hereafter
I'm already dead however I was saved with the rock

I swore I at that time. I will walk life that shines highest
There is no fear. It gets it over though there is a painful day too
Now let's go. The wing expands and goes to look for freedom and the glory
The world that extends to the place waits surely for you

踊らないか？Real Cinderella　傷だらけのガラスのマーチンで

Hey God! Are you ready?

聞かせてよ「bodies」
絶頂を教えてやるよtonight
歪みを上げて
響かせてくれtonight
どうにでもしてくれ
狂い出した夜に [DO LUCK] よりも甘い Fuck'n rollぶち込んでくれ

You can do anything to me.
Please throw the sweet Fuck'n roll rather than
the mad night 'DO LUCK'
