Out of Asgård's gates
A chariot of gold
Pulled along the way
By Tanngrisnir and Tanngnjost

Crackling thunder roars
All across the world
As he rides to war
The champion of Midgård

Thor!
Let your hammer fly
Let the lightning crack the blackened skies
Thor!
Let your hammer fly
Let the lightning crack the blackened skies
Thor!
Let your hammer fly
Let the lightning crack the blackened skies
Thor!
Let your hammer fly
Let the lightning crack the blackened skies

Travelling 'round the horn
These mates of battery
To a land forlorn
Thor and hammer Mjölner

Let your hammer fly
Let it fly
Crack the blackened sky
Crack the sky

Let your hammer fly
Let it fly
Crack the blackened sky
Crack the sky

Besieged by countless foes
His eyes they are aglow
Longing for the fight
He stands upon a mound
Doesn't aim the throw
Just lets the hammer fly

Thor!
Let your hammer fly
Let the lightning crack the blackened skies
Thor!
Let your hammer fly
Let the lightning crack the blackened skies
Thor!
Let your hammer fly
Let the lightning crack the blackened skies
Thor!
Let your hammer fly
Let the lightning crack the fucking skies
