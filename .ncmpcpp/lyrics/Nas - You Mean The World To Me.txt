Where we met, I had to give her mad respect
She was with her man, he took a drag from a cigarette
He told her he'll be back, he jumped in a meter cab
Just to her cell and tell her where to meet him at
Now she was mad, and I was looking for my car
She had some plastic bags, coming from the supermarket
Cooking for his ass, how she gone get to the projects?
She ain't got no cash and she struggling while walking
So I drive past, "Yo" I say "I ain't no stalker wit yo big ole ass
Here's my help I'm tryna offer, I give you a lift"
Who woulda knew it turn to this? Now we in the mix
Baby moved up in my crib and she left her ex
Damn I'm speedin'

I'm a king, you're a queen
His and her sinks and diamond rings
You don't have to look back at him
Just get your bags packed and then
A new life soon begins
Like I told you when I'm in, I'm in
I'm a king, you're a queen
His and her sinks and diamond rings
You don't have to look back at him
Just get your bags packed and then
A new life soon begins
Like I told you when I'm in, I'm in
I'm a king, you're a queen
His and her sinks and diamond rings
You don't have to look back at him
Just get your bags packed and then
A new life soon begins
Like I told you when I'm in, I'm in

Baby girl had a son
He was three, yeah I took him in
Now she call him little me, I even look like him
Nah, I mean he look me, a couple shades darker
She be calling him Blackie, that's 'cause his real father jet black
So she treat him like it's a setback
I don't respect that
Now his pops calling collect at the new crib on the new number
Now how he get that?
See, now I knew we was a mismatch
I'm laid back, you too used to getting pimp smacked
I see where I went wrong at
I just tried to bring the out the queen in you
But when you make a girl leave a man
You never really know where she stand
How you know she really yours?
Somebody could do the same to you
