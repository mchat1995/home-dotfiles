Let them shout
I am free as any man
A moment worth a world
I will not run
You hear me?
Let them fly
I am free as any man
A moment worth a world
I will not run

Powerless to fly
I pay it no mind
That weight's just coins for my eyes
But I'll be dancing on my grave
When dead men are not slaves
I pay no mind

This time I...
Feel that rain as we elevate
Wash it away...
(Never turn tail)
Feel that rain
Even gods were made with feet of clay

I am free as any man
I will not run

So keep your long goodbyes
I pay them no mind
I have been dust a long time
I was born into that flame
The day they took my name
I pay no mind
I feel that rain

Effortlessly I turn my eyes
And pay no mind to the darkened sky
I won't take flight when the rest turn tail
'Cause I know this moment's mine
What empty hands can't claim is buried all the same
I pay no mind
I'll find my freedom in the moment I...

Feel that rain as we elevate
Wash it away...
(Never turn tail)
Feel that rain
Even gods were made with feet of clay

Even gods and their feet of clay
Stand and stare as it washes away

Even gods and their feet of clay...

Unbind these hands
I was stronger than a time when we all
Fought like there was no light
Fought like our very flesh and bone could never falter

Feel that rain as we elevate
Wash it away...
(Never turn tail)
Let them shout
I am free as any man
A moment worth a world
I will not run
You hear me?
Let them fly
I am free as any man!

(X2) Feel that rain as we elevate
Wash it away...
(Never turn tail)
Feel that rain
Even gods were made with feet of clay

I will not run
I will not run
