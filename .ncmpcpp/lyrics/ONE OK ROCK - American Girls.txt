I'm coming straight outta Tokyo
On my way to the coast
To the heart of the culture clash
I'm ready to go
Now in the distance
They shine like neon lights
I just can't resist them
Been waiting my whole life
Come on break my heart
You American girls
How'd you get that
Reputation for taking over the world
Can't you see I'm
Out of my head for you
Can't you see I'm
Out of my head for you
American girls

You've got me so obsessed
I like when east meets west
It's like I'm in a movie
Said, do you wanna use me?
And she said "hell yes"
Now my heart's beatin'
She's got that one track mind
Always gets me kickin'
She knows just what I like

Come on break my heart
You American girls
How'd you get that
Reputation for taking over the world
Can't you see I'm
Out of my head for you
Can't you see I'm
Out of my head for you
American girls

I wanna take you out
I wanna show you off
I like the way you walk
The way you talk
The way you rock

I wanna take you out
I wanna show you off
I like the way you walk
The way you talk
The way you rock

You know who you are

Come on break my heart
You American girls
How'd you get that
Reputation for taking over the world
Can't you see I'm
Out of my head for you
Can't you see I'm
Out of my head for you
American girls

I wanna take you out
I wanna show you off
I like the way you walk
The way you talk
The way you rock

I wanna take you out
I wanna show you off
I like the way you walk
The way you rock
American girls
