Were you dying to go?
You just looked so exposed
Demure through the dark dancing lights
I glided by, I can't deny
That the shadows betrayed you and I
On that night

Oh, I must confess I am overdressed
Are you not impressed?
Darling I want to
I'll confess this too, must you know the truth?
This is all for you
Darling, I want to destroy you

As you reached for my hand
Did you then understand
It was I who would lead you that night?
When you begged to know I was glad to show
That I needn't be scared
Either way I still bite

Oh, I must confess I am overdressed
Are you not impressed?
Darling I want to
I'll confess this too, must you know the truth?
This is all for you
Darling, I want to

So here's the final scene
When I finally come clean
I've watched you for years, years
And here's my favorite part
Where you beg for my heart
And I disappear

Oh, I must confess I am overdressed
Are you not impressed?
Darling, I want to
I'll confess this too, must you know the truth?
This is all for you
Darling, I want to
Darling, I want to
Destroy you
