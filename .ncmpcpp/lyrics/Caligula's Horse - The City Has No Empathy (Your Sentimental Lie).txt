Empty streets call
Siren's song
Drift down deeper
The city's heart is waiting for me

City, soulless
All empty syringe, hollow promise and careful disguise
Bright eyes
Briefly carry the hopeful
Ever the optimist

So sing your song
Like a sight
Your sentimental lie
Liar
Open your mouth and sing like you've got something
You've got something to say

My head in my hands
Try to ignore the sound turning to sand
Cold wind carries my own voice
A whisper begging for release

I am released

So sing your song
Like a sigh
Your sentimental lie
Liar
Open your mouth and sing like you've got something
Something to say

Sing your song
Like a sigh
Your sentimental lie
Liar
Open your mouth and sing like you've got something
Something to...

Fuck this city
I've been released
I spread out wide my arms
I breathe in deep and sing
I am released
