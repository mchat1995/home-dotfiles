The dawn of time breaks
See the sun rise to the sky
The wheel of time begins to turn
But then we heard it
A divine voice out of nowhere
Spoke to our hearts and showed the way

Almighty lord, we have come to your hall
Do glatem live, creator of all
Open your heart and you will find the way
Paradise calling and enter you may (falling down)
Now your soul returns to paradise (fall down)
Double seven thirty-four

The wheel kept turning
Ages came, time passed us by
We lived in perfect harmony
And then it happened
Our ranks decreased rapidly
But now it's time for our return

Once we were numerous but that's long ago
We are no more double seven three four
Last two united and two became one
One hundred eleven
We perished in flames (falling down)

Now your soul returns to paradise
Double seven thirty-four

Almighty lord, we have come to your hall
Do glatem live, creator of all
Open your heart and you will find the way
Paradise calling and enter you may (falling down)
Now your soul returns to paradise
Double seven thirty-four (fall down)
Now your soul returns to paradise (fall down)
Double seven thirty-four
