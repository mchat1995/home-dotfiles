(WAAAoooAAAoooooh!)
(WAAAoooAAAoooooh!)

(This is where we start) It's time to wake up the fire inside
(This is where we start) Ignite your mind. Open your eyes

We all move like spirits in the wind, in the wind
We've been stripped of what used to be, be within, be within
If everyone had more soul, maybe we would have more control
We're the ones to blame if everything stays the same, stays the same

Where's the fire, the desire, an inherent right to stand up and fight?

Stand up. Stand up and fight
Stand up. I said stand up and fight

It's time to set our blood to boil
Feel the heat rise inside

(This is where we start) It's time to wake up the fire inside
(This is where we start) Ignite your mind. Open your eyes

(Where did we, where did we go wrong?)
You can't charge forward when your limbs will not listen
(Where did we, where did we go wrong?)
You can't mount a comeback when you don't know what you're missing

It's apathy turned into atrophy. A lesson learned in human anatomy

(This is where we start) It's time to wake up the fire inside
(This is where we start) Ignite your mind. Open your eyes
(This is where we start) Change has never started with silence
(This is where we start) So stop telling us to be quiet

Wake up. Wake up. Wake up the fire inside
Wake up. Wake up. It's time to open your eyes

(WAAAoooAAAoooooh!)
(WAAAoooAAAoooooh!)
