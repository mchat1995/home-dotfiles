If tomorrow never comes
Will my past and present
Be zeroed out
And become meaningless?
You ask as you stand above time

Just like the snow melts and disappears
My life has an ending
That's why I can shine

Our unseen future
I want to live strongly and laugh in the end

I don't need
Love and friendship that's just for show
They say people remember something
Just before they die
If that's true, I'll probably remember loving

Just like the snow melts and disappears
My life has an ending
That's why I can shine

Our unseen future
Begins to shine
Just be dreaming, shining

The color of the blue sky's last words
Gave me an answer
A life is mine

The regret of hesitation and overthinking
I'd rather live life to the fullest and have regrets
Than do nothing at all

Even if I wish for it to continue forever
My life has an ending
That's why I can shine

I'll shout until I'm h___se
About the meaning of facing the present

The world we're living in
Is poisoned and sometimes love is stomped out

But still I pray that on the last day
I'll remember being loved

The color of the blue sky's last words
Gave me an answer
A life is mine

The regret of hesitation and overthinking
I'd rather risk everything
Than do nothing at all
