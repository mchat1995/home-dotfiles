Winds of eternity Memory that I am here
From far beyond the time I arrive here now
The forest has been since the great antiquility
Life, Water and flower was born

With your mind...

Of yore time is future
From the boat in and empty time interstice

All things in nature
Animals dance
Insects rejoice

We arrive on the Earth
It saves me always warm
Only the nostalgy is left

The place wa here with my sense
The memory of some 1000 flows
We live in the endless time
I feel winds of eternity
All things in nature
