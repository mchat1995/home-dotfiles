I hate the way the weight of your decisions-
They weigh upon me. I won't carry them on my shoulders
My knees may buckle, but my resolve is strong
I am the future and I'm here to prove you wrong

You are concerned with dragging me down
Everything in me won't let me drown, won't let me drown

What you decide has impact on you forever
It will cave in on you forever
You can't ignore what surrounds you forever
You can't ignore what surrounds you forever

What goes up must come down
It's simple physics you see, the laws of gravity

I'll stay above the water just to prove my persistence
I'm holding on to my desire to improve our existence

The remedy starts with me
It's the logic we all need

Take hold and accept it if you want things to be different
Take hold and accept it if you want things to be different
Take hold, take hold, take hold and accept it
Take hold and accept it if you want things to be different

I'm waiting impatiently while your skin turns thin
You can't ignore what surrounds you forever. Soon enough it will all cave in

Ideas built upon a weak base
Will slip away without a trace
Like a house that's made of sand being torn
To the ground by the waves

I promise to always see things from a better perspective
One that won't block those who chose another direction
And this promise to myself, I won't let it go
(won't let it go, won't let it go)
I'll stand up, and take it all in
With open arms, I'll accept what we've been given
And this promise to myself, I won't let it go
(won't let it go, won't let it go)

Won't let it go, won't let it go
Won't let it go, won't let it go

I won't let it go
Won't let it go, won't let it go
I won't let it go

This promise to myself, I won't let it go
I won't let it go, I-

Won't let it go, won't let it go
Won't let it go, won't let it go
I won't let it go
