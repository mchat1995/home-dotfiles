I cried enough tears to see my own reflection in them,
And then it was clear - I can't deny, I really miss him...
To think that I was wrong;
I guess you don't know what you got till it's gone...
Pain is just a consequence of love;
I'm saying sorry for the sake of us...

He wasn't my everything till we were nothing, and it's taken me a lot to say,
And now that he's gone, my heart is missing something, so it's time to push my pride away,
'Cause you are, you are, you are my everything...
You are, you are, you are my everything...

I know you're not far, but I still can't handle all the distance;
You're travelling with my heart - I hope this is a temporary feeling,
'Cause it's too much to bear
Without you, and I know sorry ain't the cure...
If I cross your mind, just know I'm yours,
'Cause what we got is worth fighting for, 'cause you are...

You weren't my everything till we were nothing, and it's taken me a lot to say;
Now that you're gone, my heart is missing something, so it's time I push my pride away...
You are, you are, you are my everything...
You are, you are, you are my everything...

You are, you are, you are...
You are, you are, you are... my everything...
