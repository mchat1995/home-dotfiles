Six figures enter
They've come to destroy the world
They've called together
This storm almost every night

And I awake in another place
A familiar voice with a stranger's face speaks
I awake in another place
More unheard words

What new friends will the day bring?
Whoa, oh, oh, oh
One for one thousand acquainted
Whoa, oh, oh
What new hope will the night bring?
Whoa, oh, oh, oh
When it all comes down you just throw the bones
Whoa

On the way, I saw five hours of sleep
On the way, but your fire makes it all worth while
On the way, I wrote words for you to keep
On the way

What new friends will the day bring?
One for one thousand acquainted
What new hope will the night bring?
When it all comes down you just throw the bones

On the way, I saw five hours of sleep
On the way, but your fire makes it all worth while
On the way, I wrote words for you to keep
On the way

I saw myself
Lost myself along the way
And you were by me

On the way, I saw five hours of sleep
On the way, but your fire makes it all worth while
On the way, I wrote words for you to keep
On the way
