(I, am the greatest)
Fuck 'em all I'll never love 'em, I'm way up
Bitch you know I been above 'em, I stay up
Steppin' to me tryna talk it out
Knowin' goddamn well there ain't a fuckin' thing to talk about
Hol' up, bring it back now
That ain't no way to react now
You was talkin' all that shit but where it's at now
Huh? Where it's at

(I am the greatest) Motherfuckers get no love
Hol' up, wassup, get none
Like wassup, motherfuckers get no love
Hol' up, from me
Like wassup (I am the greatest)
Motherfuckers get no love
Hol' up, wassup, get none
Wassup, motherfuckers get no love
From me

Okay now what the fuck they talkin' 'bout?
It's like they never heard the words that came up out my mouth
It's like they just wanna discredit what I'm all about
I be in the studio, the motherfuckers fallin' out
Yeah, you know we balling out peace and love
I represent all of the above
You fuck bitches and get money, that's wassup
It's all good, but all these people do not give a fuck
And now I bet they bitchin' cause my flow switchin'
Tryna tell me what to write, up on some fan-fiction
Can't they just be happy I no longer have to face eviction?
That I'm livin' out my life, I'm livin' out my inner vision right now
I be on my Big L braggadocios rap shit
I could flow on anything from Premo to that trap shit
Sellin' out shows, I'm on that shit
Late night, dark night, crowd going batshit

(I am the greatest) Motherfuckers get no love
Hol' up, wassup, get none
Like wassup, motherfuckers get no love
Hol' up, from me
Like wassup (I am the greatest)
Motherfuckers get no love
Hol' up, wassup, get none
Wassup, motherfuckers get no love
From me (I am the greatest)

From me
Like wassup
Like wassup
