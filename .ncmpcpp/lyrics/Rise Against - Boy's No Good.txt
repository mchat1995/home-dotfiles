Spoken
Tune the electric bass to the 3rd, 4th, 5th, and 6th string
Go!

The boy's no good
Yeah, he's a fuckin'
He won't treat you like he should
I heard he's making time with this friend of mine
I heard he's talking trash
I saw that kid last night 
He's starting fights
He's got a nervous twitching 
He's just not the kid for you
He's all dressed up
He's got nothing to do, but he's got something
He's cool as anything, but he's not good
That boy's a fucking creep

The boy's no good
He's a hood
He won't treat you like he should
I said the boy's no good
He's a hood
He won't treat you like I would 
I said the boy's no good
Listen to what I say
The boy's no good
He'll fuck you anyway
The boy's no good 
I'm gonna have my say... the boy's no good
The boy's no fuckin' good
