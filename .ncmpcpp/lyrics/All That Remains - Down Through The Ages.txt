Give me strength to resent my fathers bought
Fight for the scars of dead memories
No regrets for the truth they had founded
Nevermind these tragedies

Forsaken few to live with nothing
No longer hold them down

It was done now empower my enemies
A common trend that'll crush your beliefs
A grand design (GRAND DESIGN) and tyranny
The cost of safety's paid when no one is free

Forsaken few to live with nothing
No longer hold them down
Belief is true we all just torch them
No longer hold them down

It's come down through the ages
Don't let it fall away [x2]
This gift down through the ages
Don't let it fall away [x2]

Our greatness is a proof
They know these words are true
