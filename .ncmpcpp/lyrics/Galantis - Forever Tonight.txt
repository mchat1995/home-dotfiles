Let me call love blind tonight with possibility
Set your teenage love alive, won't you follow me?
Blowing fire in the sky, burning evergreen
Before the sun is in your eyes, run away with me

Forever, our night is guided by lights
Together, we are one
Together, we are one
We'll have forever tonight, forever together, forever
We'll have forever tonight, forever
We'll have forever tonight, forever

Let me call love blind tonight with impedity
We'll be one 'til we collide, with no in between
Lighting up fires, burning evergreen
You can love me back to life, every time we see

Forever, our night is guided by lights
Together, we are one
Together, we are one
We'll have forever tonight, forever together, forever
We'll have forever tonight, forever together, forever
We'll have forever tonight, forever
We'll have forever tonight, forever
We'll have forever tonight, tonight
