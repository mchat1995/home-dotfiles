I ain't no good 
And I live by the woods 
They say I ain't bad 
I'm the best that I've had 
And I know it ain't right 
But I'll fight my whole life 
Just to prove that I was right 

The day it went down 
I was out on my pad 
Not feeling so bad 
I'm a suspect now 
I'm a vagabond tramp 
Living out on a limb 

I live by the woods 
They say I ain't bad 
I'm the best that I've had 
And I know it ain't right 
But I'll fight my whole life 
Just to prove I was right

Terrestrial fire 
Ascending from underground 
Godspeed divine 
So we control the mound 
Shapeshifter 
Spirits whisper 
Guide me through this black sorcery

Flashing teeth 
Aggressive tendencies 
Cloaked beneath 
Silver redeems
Smoking mirrors 
Black obsidian 
Tell us where to find the marrow

The prophecy 
Will be realised 
Lord of the near and the nigh 
Possessor of earth and sky

Guard your temples 
From destruction 
Make sure no one goes inside

The prophecy 
Will be realised 
Lord of the near and the nigh 
Possessor of earth and sky

It's right in front of me 
The throne of maladies 
It's right in front of me 
Your malignancy

It's right in front of me 
The throne of maladies 
It's right in front of me 
Your malignancy

It's right in front of me 
The throne of maladies 
It's right in front of me 
Your malignancy
