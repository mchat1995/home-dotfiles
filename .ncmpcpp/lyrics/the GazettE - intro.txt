i was in love with a girl on marijuana
she said, "if i'm not stoned i don't wanna"
but she got so paranoid
her place i would avoid
i was in love with a girl on marijuana

i was in love with a girl on cocaine
she had everything going but her brain
we'd talk endlessly for hours
but by morning it goes sour
i was in love with a girl on cocaine

through ectasy, crystal meth and glue
i found no drug compares to you
all these pills, all this weed
i don't know just what i need

i was in love with a girl on LSD
she'd see things i'd never see
she broadened her perspective
then i got more selective
i was in love with a girl on LSD

through ectasy, crystal meth and glue
i found no drug compares to you
all these pills, all this weed
i don't just what i need

i was in love with a girl who drank beer
till bad breath and all she disappeared
she was blowing up real bad
but when she left i was still sad
i was in love with a girl who drank beer

i was in love with a girl on china white
we were married for a year one night
her memory still lingers
cause i burned all my fingers
i was in love with a girl on china white

i was in love with a girl who drank coffee
there was times when i couldn't keep her off me
that caffeine got her going
but her ugly side was showing
i was in love with a girl who drank coffee

i was in love with a girl who was a dealer
i was afraid somebody would come and steal her
we never used to fight
but the phone rang day and night
i was in love with a girl who was a dealer

sure as hell
she got popped by the big guys
