Crawl with insects and feed on barren soil!
Or rise above the animal in you!
Find kindness among the unkind!
Slowness ov decrepitude
Like sirens beckoning me to their ruined shores!
Impotent in the eye ov the storm!
Cthonic ore forefathers!
Ravishing sires ov the black hosts!

Feast on their bones!
Feed on their flesh!
Ares!
Adonis!
Astarte!
Prometheus' Rebirth!

Ere constellations were dust!
And thus thou empowered me!
I am legion in company ov seraphs!
At the threshold ov this godless anarchy!
Malediction to all that is Angelic!
Pariah ov collapsing truth!
Crucifixion was not enough!
The alpha ov this mortal whorl!

Feed on their bones!
Feed on their flesh!
Bael!
Orobas!
Astaroth!
Asmoday's Rebirth!
