The people have spoken
We are the new generation
We are a sign
The hope in our desperation
That binds the right and wrong
Thought demolition and elimination
The people have spoken
Through walls claimed unbroken
We are the history and its revolution
We are the sign
Through chaos, disorder
We build from the ground
We are the sign
We are the light
Cause we the people have spoken
