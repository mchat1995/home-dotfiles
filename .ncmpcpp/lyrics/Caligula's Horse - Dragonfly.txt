So she is running still
And I am held here in her spark
Earthquakes and easy pace
Echoes that left their precious mark
And she smiles like an open grave
Mercy

Won't you beckon me into you?

Winter, my dragonfly
Letting me drown here for a while
Earthquakes and easy pace
What I would give
Just one more taste

Shiver, winter, my dragonfly
Peace in porcelain
Wild like wine
Drink my fill of your precious purpose
Let it fill my chest
Sing that sorrow
The soul undressed
Drink my fill of this fearless goddess
The dragonfly
Fierce, unbroken and crucified
Eyes like truth
Just like she's always known
And she smile like an open grave, mercy

Won't you please beckon me into you?

Winter, my dragonfly
Letting me drown here for a while
Earthquakes and easy pace
What I would give
Just one more taste

Fire, feed me
Just a little longer
Shapeless
Breathing
Carry me to light

Let fire feed me
Just a little longer
Shapeless
Breathing
Carry me to light
Winter, my dragonfly
Letting me drown here for a while
Earthquakes and easy pace
What I would give for her...

Holding on
It's alright
It's alright now

And I never could find a grave that I wouldn't fall into
I am grateful for the climb
And I reach for the echoes you left
Teaching me patience
And I am better for the yearning
I'm not lost yet

So she runs faster again
Quietly hoping to free herself into the breathing
Stand in the warmth of that light
The spark that she gave to me
I am ready, I am certain
I'm not lost yet

She's willing to pour her all
Fierce, defiant, a voice I know
It's you...
But you'll never see me coming
But you'll never see me coming

(X2) I come by cloak and dagger in her light
I, the spark's long fight
Fire, feed me
But you'll never see me coming
