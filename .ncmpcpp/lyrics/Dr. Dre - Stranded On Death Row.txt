Intro: Bushwick Bill
Yes, it is I says me
And although agree are more than 3 'cause they're we
*Laughter*
Yes, yo! I'm in the house now for sure
Because I wanna talk about the hearts of men
Who knows what evil lurks within' them
But let's take a travel down the blindside
And see what we find on this...
Path...
Called...

Verse 1: Kurupt
Stranded On Death Row, so duck when I swing my shit
I get rugged like Rawhead Rex with fat tracks that fits
The gangsta type, what I recite's kinda lethal
Niggas know, the flow that I kick, there's no equal
I'm murderin' niggas, Yo and maybe because of the tone
I kicks when I grip the mic and kick shit
Niggas can't fuck with
So remember I go hardcore and slam
Nuff respect like a sensei, ba-bash like Van Damme
So any nigga that claim they bossin
What don't you bring your ass on over to Crenshaw and Slauson
Take a walk through the hood when we up to no good
Slangin' them things like a real O.G. should
I'm stackin' and mackin' and packin' a 10 so
When your slippin' I slip the clip in
But ain't no set trippin'
'Cause it's Death Row, rollin' like the mafia
Think about whippin' some ass, but what the fuck stoppin' ya
Ain't nathin' but a buster
I'm Stranded On Death Row for pumpin' slugs in muthafuckers
Now you know your outdone
Feel the shotgun, Kurupt inmate, cell block one.

Verse 2: RBX
No prevention from this mention of sorts
You're a victim, from my driveby of thoughts
No extensions, all attempts are to fail
Blinded by the light, it's time you learn braile
From the lunatic, I death like arsenic
When I kick up wicked raps
Dr. Dre will kick the scratch
With treachery, my literary form will blast
And totally surpass the norm
Not a storm, plural, make it, many storms
When I'm vexed, I fly leg necks and arms
In this dimension, I'm the presenter
And the inventor and the tormentor
Deranged, like the hillside strangler
MC mangler, tough like Wrangler
I write a rhyme, hard as concrete
Step to the heat and get burned like mesquite.
So what you wanna do?
The narrator RBX, cell block 2.

Verse 3: Rage
Rage, lyrical murderer
Stranded On Death Row
And now I'm servin' a lifetime sentence
There'll be no repentance
Since it's the life that I choose to lead
I plead guilty
On all counts let the ball bounce where it may
It's just another clip into my AK
Buck 'em down with my underground tactics
Facts and stacks of clips on my mattress
Bed frame there's another dead pain
Layin' lain' with the shame, who's to blame
Me, the lady of Rage
On when I'm comin' from the D E A T H in
R O W takin' no shit
So flip and your bound to get dropped
It's 187 on muthafuckers don't stop
Handcuffed as I bust there'll be no debate
It's Rage, from cell block 8.

Verse 4: Snoop Dogg
And yo' steppin' through the fog
And creepin' through the smog
It's the #1 nigga from the hood, Doggy Dogg
Makin' videos, now I stay in Hollywood
Bustin' raps for my snaps now they call me Eastwood
Dre is the doctor and my homey little nigga
Warren G is my hand and my hand's on the trigga
Shootin' at the hoes with the game that I got
Sent to Death Row 'cause I wanted to make a grip from servin' my rocks
And I'm still, servin' for mines, peace
To my muthafuckin' homies doin' time
In the pen and the county jail
Mobbin' with your blues on, mad as hell
And you say yeah fuck the police
And all the homies on the streets is all about peace
And it's drivin' the cops crazy
But ain't nuttin' but a black thing bay-bee, uh
No I'm not flaggin' but I'm just saggin'
I betcha don't wanna see the D O double G
And you can't see the D R to the E
Or my muthafuckin' homey D.O.C.
You know you can't fuck with my muthafuckin' DJ
That's my homey and we call him Warren G
Yeah and you don't stop
Doggy Dogg break 'em down with the muthafuckin' Dogg Pound
That's the only way we'll beat 'em man
We gotta smoke 'em, then choke 'em
Like the muthafuckin' peter man
It's like 3 & to the 2
And 2 & to the 1
Cell block 4 peace Doggy Dogg's done.

Outro : Bushwick Bill
Yo, now you know the path I'm on
You think your strong, see if you can travel on
'Cause only the weak, will try to speak
Those who are quiet, will always cause riots
There's 3 types of people in the world
Those who don't know what happened
Those who wonder what happened
And people like us from the streets that make things happen!
