These will be times that I will miss
Don't blame me if I don't come through
I've spent a lifetime on this
But I would give it all to you

'Cause I know what you do out of passion
But it only makes it harder for me
And I know that you're scared by the notion
We'll become who we're meant to be

Fall in the hands of greater unknown
Let me be there
And tell me if you need time to prepare
All will amount his world

'Cause I know what you do out of passion
But it only makes it harder for me
And I know that you're scared by the notion
We'll become who we're meant to be

Oh what we meant to be
Oh what we meant to be
Oh what we meant to be
Oh what we meant to be
We'll become who we meant to be
We'll become who we meant because I know
We'll become who we meant to be
We'll become who we meant because I know
We'll become who we meant to be
