A wounded heart will fade away
the love is destroying you, in full bloom with the flowers.

JEALOUS

Since that day I didn't know what to about him
for some reason my heart has rejected (him)
His form is changing, far away but all too close
Should I wear a mask, so I can hide my face drawn with tension
when I'm with him.
my heart lost in my body will someday leave me

I'll bloom as the poison flower
and become the flower that blooms again.

A wounded heart will fade away
the love is destroying you, in full bloom with the flowers.

I'll bloom as the poison flower
and become the flower that blooms again.

I can't laugh like I used to,
I'm not the same person who loved him.
I only held that crumbling man once that february night,
I can't forget the 'you' that I loved.

A wounded heart will fade away
the love is destroying you, in full bloom with the flowers.
