Bring it
It's the end of the world
Judgement has slowly begun
Seize the moment before it's gone
Killas
(To) gotta reason tonight
(To) feast on their preys alive

Scars won't go away
Unless you start to live with it
Override (to) overdrive

Drown yourself in pain we drown ourselves
We're gonna take it all now
Time will take all our dreams away
We're gonna take it all now

Get up
Eat dirt with facedown
Come take a look around It just begun
When you win some you gotta lose some
"What you waiting for? Cut me up now"
Who the fuck cares even if I do
I got my reason and I don't need to prove
Who I am is just a piece of ART
Letting you see the birth of a man's heart

Scars won't go away
Unless you start to live with it
Override (to) overdrive

Drown yourself in pain we drown ourselves
We're gonna take it all now
Time will take all our dreams away
We're gonna take it all now

We've made ourselves to break ourselves
This is how we've detained
So break ourselves to make ourselves
These scars will know
These scars will show
This is the moment I've been waiting for
We were made to burn
So burn away

We are nothing more than existence
Unless we search beyond ourselves
Can you feel it?
Because I feel it too
Just like you
Disease, depression, isolation, misery, lost, good-byes, "No brain No pain"
There's no gain without pain

Drown yourself in pain we drown ourselves
We're gonna take it all now
Time will take all our dreams away
We're gonna take it all now
