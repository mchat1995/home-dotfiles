<No escape, I navigate through my cave
Beneath the skin, they keep us in night and day
Parasite, leech upon the guilt from all my wrongs
Lead me on the pathway to the core
Paralyzed, staring through the shadows on the wall
Unable to solve this puzzle box
Truth or deception?
I lose all perception inside
A fleeting sense of self-worth (Self-worth)
Evaporates into nothingness
A tepid grip on myself (Myself)
Melts away to oblivion
Shadows on the wall dance around
Reflections in the amber to be found
A puppet on a string soon unwound
The truth inside the cave soon to be unbound
The path beyond the mountain led me here
The answer crystallized in history
But now the cracks of time begin to show
We lift the veil on what the future holds
The torture...>
