Oh, my story's not the oldest of its kind
I was too touched to see you clearly, far too young to realize
I had loved so dearly you, whose world I had designed
But the sweet smoke came with mirrors, and it brought tears to my wide eyes

I'm dying just to see you
Dying since I misconstrued your

Blue heart
Black eyes
Feigning, falling, words I won't forget
I died
Right when I
Saw you while you shared that cigarette

Oh, I saw you every time I closed my eyes
In the Hughes film I had scored, produced and starred in in my mind
I could recite you, well, I'd written every line
But you strayed far from my flawless script on which I'd spent a lifetime

Falling over dead
Dying since I had misread your

Blue heart
Black eyes
Feigning, falling, words I won't forget
I died
Right when I
Saw you while you shared that cigarette

(Oh)
(Oh)
(Oh)
(Oh)

Falling over dead (over dead)
Dying since I had misread your

Blue heart
Black eyes
Feigning, falling, words I won't forget
I died
Right when I
Saw you while you shared that cigarette
