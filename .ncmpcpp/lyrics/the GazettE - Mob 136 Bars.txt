A crazy man in the same trade
Show me your face
A violence society?
It can laugh
Teach it to my mom
You get your ass kicked
Begin to scream like a man?

The destroyer of the anachronism
I believed in all your words
Though it became such a result now
It was loved

Absorb fear and die
Know all the pain given to it
Absorb fear and die
Die staring at yourself

Tell me the truth and a lie
Am I being deceived?
Who is an enemy?
Tell me...

Obedience is the sign of the death
Think firmly with your brain
Obedience is the sign of the death
Prosecute a man folly

Tell me the truth and a lie
