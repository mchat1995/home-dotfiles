Life is full of ups and downs
I keep on searching for permanent security and satisfaction
We sometimes get great achievement and encounter disappointment

Fushou bushou na kono sekai yue ni fujouri jitsuni teimei
Sore wo damatte yari sugosu
Sonna mainichi to wa osaraba baibai
You kiss my ass !!

Let's shake it down
Get it up !
What I am doing is what you're thinking now
Everybody nanimokamo topparatte
Let's shake it down
Get on up !
Madamada korekara let's dance
Kata ni wa hamarazu you shake it down

One day, the sun is shining
It makes me feel alive and makes me so rash
Another day, the sky is so dark
I'm here crying alone looking down all the time

Fushou bushou na kono sekai yue ni fujouri jitsuni teimei
Sore wo damatte yari sugosu
Sonna mainichi to wa osaraba baibai
I come from nowhere, I'm now here
You know what I mean ?

Let's shake it down
Get it up !
What I am doing is what you're thinking now
Everybody nanimokamo topparatte
Let's shake it down
Get on up !
Madamada korekara let's dance
Kata ni wa hamarazu you shake it down

This is your life suki na you ni sawaide ware wasurete

Let's shake it down
Get it up !
What I am doing is what you're thinking now
Everybody nanimokamo topparatte
Let's shake it down !
Get on up !
Madamada koko kara let's dance
Yoko wa kimi sezu you shake it down
