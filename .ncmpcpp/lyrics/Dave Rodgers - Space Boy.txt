Every night you light me with your gasoline
Everytime I feel delight when you recall my name

So you can be my shining star tonight
I'm not alone with all your love
Fly across the sky, you will be mine
I can feel your dream with you, babe

Gonna get you
Like a space boy
Woah woah woah woah
I'm ready, babe
Gonna get you
I'm your space boy
Dive into your heart, baby

Gonna get you
Like a space boy!
Woah woah woah woah
I need you, babe
Gonna get you
Like a space boy
Take a chance with me, baby

Every night you drive me crazy like you know
Everyday I scream so loud you'll always be my queen

So you can be my shining star tonight
I'm not alone with all your love
Fly across the sky
You will be mine
I can feel your dream with you babe

Gonna get you
Like a space boy!
Woah woah woah woah
I'm ready, babe
Gonna get you
I'm your space boy
Dive into your heart, baby

Gonna get you
Like a space boy
Woah woah woah woah
I need you, babe
Gonna get you
I'm your space boy
Take a chance with me, baby

Gonna get you
Space boy
Gonna get you
I'm a space boy

Gonna get you
Like a space boy
Woah woah woah woah
I need you, babe
Gonna get you
I'm a space boy
Take a chance with me, baby
