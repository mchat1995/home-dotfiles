Hey, man now did you hear
Your final days are near?
In a free fall of fire and ice
And explosions in the sky

A fate that we deserve
There's no escape, No
Now it's your turn
Now it's your turn

It's been years
Since our luck ran out and left us here
Like broken mirrors
Ten million shards of glass and tears
But now we are
Awake enough to shatter what we hate
Like broken mirrors
Reflections of an unfamiliar face

Hey, hey!

Hey, man, you got the time?
Hey, can I trouble you for a light?
Who, me? no, I'm not the old town crier
I'm the one who sets it all on fire

A fate, yeah, that we deserve
And there's no escape, No
Now it's your turn
Now it's your turn

It's been years
Since our luck ran out and left us here
Like broken mirrors
Ten million shards of glass and tears
But now we are
Awake enough to shatter what we hate
Like broken mirrors
Reflections of an unfamiliar face

We hide from the mirrors
They might show our scars
And hear us
(Go Go Go)
Reflection that we want to be
The people we are (the people we are)
Confront your reflection
Smash what you see
And let's restart
Cause mirrors can't see our heart

It's been years
Since our luck ran out and left us here
Like broken mirrors
Ten million shards of glass and tears
But now we are
Awake enough to shatter what we hate
Like broken mirrors
Like broken mirrors
Like broken mirrors
Like broken mirrors
Like broken mirrors
Reflections of an unfamiliar face
