I say, betrayer, swear I've given you so much
Naysayer, I watched as you just lapped it up
Unwilling, addicted to be without dignity
A cheater, you thrive on lechery

I don't know what I expected
Was our time even real?
Your callous heart never seemed affected
Does a liar even know how to feel?

Unto you I proclaim
Creonte shall be your name

I'll never be a victim for you
I'll never be your fool
I'll never be a victim, betrayer (Betrayer)

You're calculating, I know you know exactly
What you're doing, your selfishness, your only cause
A fake, a farce; you had us all convinced
No guilt, no heart, no love, no conscience held

Unto you I proclaim
Creonte shall be your name

I'll never be a victim for you
I'll never be your fool
I'll never be a victim, betrayer (Betrayer)
Betrayer (Betrayer)

Time will not mend, all these mistakes have now
Brought forth the end for you, my friend
Time will not end, all these mistakes have now
Brought forth the end for you, my friend

I say, betrayer

A fake, a farce (You had us all convinced)
No guilt, no heart, no love, no conscience held

Unto you I proclaim
Creonte shall be your name

I'll never be a victim for you
I'll never be your fool
I'll never be a victim, betrayer
