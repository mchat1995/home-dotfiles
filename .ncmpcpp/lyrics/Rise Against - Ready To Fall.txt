Hold on, slow down, again from the top now
And tell me everything
I know I've been gone for what seems like forever
But I'm here now waiting

To convince you that I'm not a ghost or a stranger
But closer than you think
She said, "Just go on to what you pretend is your life but
Please don't die on me"

Wings won't take me
Heights don't phase me, so take a step
But don't look down, take a step

Now I'm standing on a rooftop, ready to fall
I think I'm at the edge now but I could be wrong
I'm standing on a rooftop, ready to fall

Perpetual motion, the image won't focus
A blur is all that's seen
But here in this moment, like the eye of the storm
It all came clear to me

I found a shoulder to lean on
An infallible reason to live all by itself
I took one last look from the heights that I once loved
And then I ran like hell

Wings won't take me
Heights don't phase me, so take a step
But don't look down, take a step

Now I'm standing on a rooftop, ready to fall
I think I'm at the edge now but I could be wrong
I'm standing on a rooftop, ready to fall

I count the times that I've been sorry (I know, I know)
While my compassion slowly drowns (I know, I know)
If there's a time these walls could guard you (I know, I know)
Then let that time be right now

Now I'm standing on a rooftop
Now I'm standing on a rooftop, ready to fall

I'm standing on a rooftop, ready to fall
I think I'm at the edge now but I could be wrong
I'm standing on a rooftop, ready to fall

Now I'm standing on a rooftop (Ready to fall)
Now I'm standing on a rooftop (Ready to fall)
Now I'm standing on a rooftop (Ready to fall)
Now I'm standing on a rooftop, ready to fall
