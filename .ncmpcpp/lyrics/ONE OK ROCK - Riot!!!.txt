Everybody screaming
Everybody moving
Let's get it started
Gotta make a riot now

If you feel so empty and feel so tired
When I'm sick of fake smile and fake words
We're all wired

Itsudatte bokura hora
Jibun wo gomakashite iru kara

Everybody screaming
Everybody moving
I'm going crazy
So what are you gonna do now
I'm not only one
Just like you, yeah
We are all the same
I can make it now

When I'm sick of being the one who always tells everything
Nothing can keep us from doing this
Gotta make a riot now

Dare datte minna hora
Naite waratte ikite iru kara

Everybody screaming
Everybody moving
I'm going crazy
So what are you gonna do now
I'm not only one
Just like you, yeah
We are all the same
I can make it now

Everybody screaming
Everybody moving
I'm going crazy
This is all we got now
I'm not only one
Just like you, yeah
You and I are one
Make a riot now!
