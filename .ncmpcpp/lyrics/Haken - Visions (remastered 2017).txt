"What is life? An illusion, a shadow, a story.
And the greatest good is little enough,
For all life is a dream
And dreams themselves are only dreams..."

"We have all some experience of a feeling,
That comes over us occasionally,
Of what we are saying and doing
Having been said and done before, in a remote time -
Of our having been surrounded, dim ages ago,
By the same faces, objects, and circumstances -
Of our knowing perfectly what will be said next,
As if we suddenly remember it!"

Spirits of the night
Communicate with me
Their visions of a future
Of what is yet to be

As I see the way I die
And I try to change it
I am running short of time
I'll just sit here waiting

Till the moment comes around
Like I've been here once before
And I'm questioning the truth
No escaping déjà vu

"There is a drowsy state, between sleeping and waking,
When you dream more in five minutes
With your eyes half open, and yourself half conscious
Of everything that is passing around you
Than you would in five nights with your eyes fast closed,
And your senses wrapt in perfect unconsciousness."

"Dreams are real as long as they last. Can we say more of life?"

If I could harness this power
Assume absolute control
Of my visions from a future
No one will ever know

That I've seen the day you die
And I tried to change it
You are running short of time
You'll just sit there waiting

Till the moment comes around
Like you've been there once before
And you're questioning the truth
No escaping déjà vu

Till the moment comes around
Like you've been there once before
And there's nothing left to lose
No escaping déjà vu

Faces become strangely familiar
Stumbling upon traces of my visions

Now I see a shadow of a man
In my silhouette he stands
The wisdom of my premonition comes to life!
I was just a kid back then but now I'm back to take revenge
I sternly look my killer in the eye

I'm out for satisfaction when I'm suddenly distracted
By the silent cries that echo in the streets
My finger pulls the trigger
With my whole life left to figure if the boy I accidentally killed was me

Voices become strangely deceiving
Gravity's pull has zero effect on me

Now the moment's finally here
And it feels just like before
Only now I face the truth
I will have to wait no more

Will this ever end?
I've been through enough
This is the part where I wake up with blood on my hands
Traveling back to where it all began

As for the boy, it pleased me to know
That he'll just wake up nine years old, alone and afraid
He'll live for the day this moment comes around again

Now the moment's finally here
And it feels just like before
Even now I know the truth
I accept my fate no more

I bet you don't remember me
I guess you won't forget
The only way to go
When there is nowhere left to roam

Scenes from someone else's lifetime
Flash like bright lights before my eyes
Scenes from someone else's lifetime
Flash like bright lights in my eyes

From the beginning I never dreamt I was the killer

Over the edge, falling in and out of time

Yeah the moment passed us by
And it felt just like before
As I leave this world behind
I know I'll come back for more
