Tucson, Arizona
Rising in the heat
Like a mirage

Tony keeps his Chevy
Like a virgin
Locked in his garage

He brings it out at midnight
And cruises down
The empty boulevards

And he prowls
The darkened alleys
That snake between
The city's thirsty yards

The lonely desert skies
Reflect the anger in his eyes
And it is dawn

His father died of drinking
And left five children sinking
With his mom

His older brother Bobby
Never made it back
From Vietnam

With high school well behind him
He lives at home and
Works this shitty job

And he thinks his '60 Chevy
Is the only true amigo
That he's got

His heart is filled with sadness
And his soul is like
Some ugly vacant lot

Mary Estelle Hanna
Come out from Louisiana
For the sun

A deal gone bad in Dallas
Left her burned and broke
And on the run

To make the rent and groceries
She takes this job at
$3.15 an hour

Serving shots of whiskey and tequila
In some smoky red-neck bar

And she dreams some day
She'll make her way to L.A.
And become a movie star

Tony saw her working
He swallowed hard and
Asked her for a date

Mary laughed and answered
"I would but every night
I'm working late"

He said he had some cocaine
That she could have
If she'd just ride along

She said, "What the hell
I may as well
I haven't had no fun
In so damn long"

He picked her up at closing time
They pulled out on the road
And they were gone

Tony's mom got frantic
When she found her son
Had not come home

Mary's roommate panicked
And called the sheriff
From a public phone

They asked her lots of questions
She tried her best to tell
Them what she saw

And late that night
They found poor Mary
Lying in some narrow, dusty draw

And the coroner reported
That she hadn't been
Deceased for very long

Two weeks on they found it
Buried to the windshield
In the sand

There inside lay Tony
With a small revolver
In his hand

The papers simply stated
It must have been the
Drugs that drove him mad

The neighbors speculated
What could make a good boy
Go so bad?

Well, it might have been
The desert heat
It might have been the
Home he never had
