Watch the stars turn you to nothing
Now blush and smile as they whisk you away
Part your lips a bit more, I'll swallow your fear, I will show you how
All the bite marks impress a need to be here, a need to see

City lights, like rain, dance and explode
Fall upon debutantes
Reeling from nights that kiss and control
All of our broken hearts

Velvet burns wrists while restraining
You blushed and smiled and said you would stay
One more time steal my breath, I'll feed you the sky, I will show you how.
Steal the glamor from death and before you die, oh, you should see

City lights, like rain, dance and explode
Fall upon debutantes
Reeling from nights that kiss and control
All of our broken hearts

All our hearts

"We all wanna die like movie stars," you said, as you jumped from the height of our cutting room floor, while above us, glowing, exploding, our dreams burst forth in light and death. Hold me, and tell me "We'll burn like stars. We'll burn as we fall. Watch as city lights dance for us."

City lights, like rain, dance and explode
Fall upon debutantes
Reeling from nights that kiss and control
All of our broken hearts
