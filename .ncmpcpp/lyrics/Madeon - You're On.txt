Tell me whose side you're on 
Tell me whose side you're on 
You're on, You're on 
Tell me whose side you're on 

You have some nerve showing your face here 
It had been so long 
I thought you'd disappeared 
Why'd you pretend that we're still so close 
It was all too clear 
We need love 

Damn girl, since you've come around, girl 
Need to know right now, so 
Won't you just 
Tell me whose side you're on 
Lately, I've felt the chance that maybe 
You could become my baby 
If you just 
Tell me whose side you're on 

Tell me whose side you're on 
You're on, you're on 
Tell me whose side you're on 

It's been so long since I've heard your thing 
I was losing hope 
Thought you felt the same 
And it's been so long since I've seen your face 
Doubting my own mind 
I had been replaced 

Damn girl, since you've come around, girl 
Need to know right now, so 
Won't you just 
Tell me whose side you're on 
Lately, I've felt the chance that maybe 
You could become my baby 
If you just 
Tell me whose side you're on 

Tell me whose side you're on 
You're on, you're on 
Tell me whose side you're on 

Damn girl, since you've come around, girl 
Need to know right now, so 
Won't you just 
Tell me whose side you're on 
Lately, you've had the chance to maybe 
You could become my baby 
If you just 
Tell me whose side you're on
