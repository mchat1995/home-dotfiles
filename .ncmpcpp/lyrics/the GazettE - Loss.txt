A bad situation
Right from the start
She played me for a fool
And she broke my heart
An infatuation
A hard loss to take
But we all must make our
own mistakes.

Let her go
I knew I had to let her go
You know it wasn't easy
It was painfully slow
But I swear I finally
let her go.

All of these feelings
Were so long ago
I haven't felt a thing
since I let her go
But you don't believe it
You still have your doubts
And while you do the
tension mounts.

Let her go
You know you got to let her go
You know it's never easy
It's painfully slow
But you know you got to
Let her go.

I will not deny it
I tried to hold on
But human hearts can only
stay broke so long
I told you the truth
How much more can I do
Now, my love, it's up to you.

Let her go
You know you got to let her go
You know it's never easy
It's painfully slow
But you know you got to
Let her go.

Let her go
You know you got to let her go
You know it's never easy
It's got to be slow
But you know you go to
Let her go.
