Reach through my window and pull the shades
No shine, no sunlight, just cold and grey
There's no way to rise from beneath your wings
Chained to your side, I can never leave

You choke out the light like a cloud hanging over me (Shadowmaker)
You're dragging me down with your suicidal symphony (Shadowmaker)
Over my head, over my head

Everything is so empty, no glass half full
How can someone so beautiful be so miserable?
I'd follow you down to the edges of Earth
Just to hear you say that your life is cursed

You choke out the light like a cloud hanging over me (Shadowmaker)
You're dragging me down with your suicidal symphony (Shadowmaker)
Over my head, over my head

You won't let me leave and I don't wanna stay
But the price on my head is weighing me down
And it feels like I'm dying inside
But you don't care, we carry on

You won't let me leave and I don't wanna stay
But the price on my head is weighing me down
And it feels like I'm dying inside
But you don't care, we carry on

You choke out the light like a cloud hanging over me
You're dragging me down with your suicidal symphony (Shadowmaker)
You choke out the light like a cloud hanging over me (Shadowmaker)
You're dragging me down with your suicidal symphony (Shadowmaker)
Over my head, over my head

Back the fuck up
Back the fuck up
Back the fuck up
