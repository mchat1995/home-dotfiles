I'm a suspect, I'm a traitor
I'm only here in body visiting
Yellow faces and the distant screams
The beauty is in what isn't said
I'm rising to my feet

Because tonight, the world turned in me
Because right now, I don't dare to breathe
Oh, babe, I know
It's alive, and somewhere for us to find tonight
Chase this light with me

My gesso, my last call
My life is yours in your gifted hands
Confetti rainfall and the quiet street
These things I've found are special now
The knot is in my reach

Because tonight, the world turned in me
Because right now, I don't dare to breathe
Oh, babe, I know
It's alive and somewhere for us to find tonight
Chase this light with me

Movie still-photograph
Through a martyr's eyes I can see
I've seen the best of love, the best of hate, the best reward is earned
And I've paid for every single word I ever said

Confetti rainfall in the quiet streets
The beauty is in what you make it
So get up on your feet

Because tonight, the world turned in me
Because right now, I don't dare to breathe
Oh, babe, I know
It's alive and somewhere for us to find tonight
Chase this light with me

Oh, babe, I know
It's alive and somewhere for us to find tonight
Chase this light with me
