This is our burden. The pain we endure

We must carry it together. It will soon become a memory
(Become a memory)
It's staring us in the face, but we just turn the other way

Take the easy route while millions of people's homes fall to the ground
Merciless and unforgiving as it sets us back. The truth could bury us all in the end

You and I walk carefully
And just hope, hope that our tracks just disappear
We don't want to leave an imprint
This can't be what we're known for

I'll leave the world as it was given to me
Flowing full of life, filled with diversity
I'll leave the world as it was given to me
Flowing full of life, filled with diversity
I can look with pride in my child's eyes
And he will know
I helped preserve what may have died
And he will know

What I've done

(He will know. He will know.)

We will look ahead

The trail I've left won't lead the history books
Right back to me. Right back to me
This generation won't let it all just slip away, slip away
Don't let it slip away

I'll walk forward and sense the ground beneath me
The choice is mine. I need to make the right one
The earth may remember what we have done
The choice is mine. I need to make the right one
